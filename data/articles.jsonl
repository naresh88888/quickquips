It targets a weak point in the bacteria’s defenses, even in drug-resistant forms of the disease. Created using a cutting-edge chemistry method, the drug shows promise for being both powerful and safe. Scientists believe it could lead to shorter, more effective treatments for millions of people.\n- Share:\nScientists have created a promising new compound that could mark a major step forward in the global effort to control tuberculosis, the world's deadliest infectious disease.\nA new study in Nature highlights the potential of this compound, called CMX410, which targets a key enzyme in Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the bacterium that causes tuberculosis. The compound has shown success even against drug-resistant strains, a growing global problem that makes treatment more difficult and less effective.\nThe research was led by James Sacchettini, Ph.D., the Rodger J. Wolfe-Welch Foundation Chair in Science and professor at Texas A&M University, along with Case McNamara, Ph.D., senior director of infectious disease at the Calibr-Skaggs Institute for Innovative Medicines, a division of Scripps Research that develops next-generation therapies.\nThis discovery emerged from collaborations within the TB Drug Accelerator program, a Gates Foundation-funded initiative that brings together researchers to advance the most promising tuberculosis treatments.\n\"A lot of people think of tuberculosis as a disease of the past,\" Sacchettini said. \"But in reality, it remains a major public health issue requiring significant attention, collaboration and innovation to overcome.\"\nA new approach to an old enemy\nThe newly identified compound from AgriLife Research and Calibr-Skaggs works by shutting down a vital enzyme, polyketide synthase 13 (Pks13), which the bacterium needs to build its protective cell wall. Without this structure, M. tuberculosis cannot survive or infect the body.\nScientists have long known that Pks13 is an important target for TB drugs, but developing a safe and effective inhibitor has proven difficult. CMX410 succeeds where earlier attempts fell short. Its design makes it extremely specific to its target, resulting in fewer unwanted effects. The compound forms an irreversible bond with a critical site on Pks13, which prevents resistance from developing and keeps the drug focused on its intended target.\nTo achieve this, researchers used a technique known as click chemistry -- a method that links molecules together like puzzle pieces. The approach was pioneered by co-author Barry Sharpless, Ph.D., W.M. Keck Professor of Chemistry at Scripps Research and a two-time Nobel Laureate. His work has opened the door to vast libraries of chemical compounds that can be rapidly tested and refined.\n\"This technique represents a new tool for drug design,\" said McNamara. \"We expect to see its uses expand in the coming years to help address public health concerns with a critical need, including tuberculosis.\"\nPromising early results\nThe team began by screening a collection of compounds from the Sharpless lab to find those capable of slowing M. tuberculosis growth. After months of optimization, led by co-first authors Baiyuan Yang, Ph.D., and Paridhi Sukheja, Ph.D., CMX410 emerged as the most effective and balanced candidate.\nYang's team tested more than 300 variations to fine-tune the compound's power, safety, and selectivity. The final version was tested against 66 different TB strains, including multidrug-resistant samples taken from patients, and proved effective in nearly all cases.\n\"Identifying this novel target was an exciting moment,\" said Sukheja, who led many early studies showing CMX410 could target a previously unexplored gene. \"It opened up a completely new path forward, especially against strains that have learned to evade existing treatments.\"\nThe researchers also found that CMX410 can be used safely alongside existing TB drugs, a crucial advantage since treatment typically involves multiple medications taken for several months. In animal testing, no negative side effects were observed even at the highest doses. Because of its precision, the compound is unlikely to disturb healthy bacteria or cause gut imbalance -- an issue often linked to traditional antibiotics.\nMoving closer to better therapies\nThe addition of a specialized chemical group that allows CMX410 to permanently attach to its target makes it one of the most selective compounds of its kind. Although more studies are needed before it can be tested in humans, early findings suggest strong potential for future TB treatment.\n\"These early results are very encouraging,\" said Inna Krieger, Ph.D., senior research scientist in Sacchettini's lab and co-first author of the paper. \"Cell wall-targeting antibiotics have long been a cornerstone of tuberculosis treatment. However, after decades of widespread use, their effectiveness is waning due to the rise of drug-resistant strains.\n\"We are working to discover new drugs that disrupt essential biological processes and identify optimal combinations with existing drugs to enable shorter, safer and more effective treatment regimens. Through these efforts, we hope to help move the world closer to a future free from tuberculosis.\"\nStory Source:\nMaterials provided by Texas A&M AgriLife. Original written by Ashley Vargo.

They discovered that distinct regions activate for facial versus limb pain, showing the brain’s built-in precision pain control system. The findings could lead to targeted, non-opioid treatments that use cannabinoid mechanisms instead of opioids, offering safer pain relief options.\n- Share:\nKey Research Findings\n- Scientists have discovered that the human brain has its own built-in pain map, activating different regions when easing pain in the face, arms, or legs.\n- Placebo pain relief only works in the exact area where the brain expects it to happen.\n- Understanding this system could lead to safer, more precise treatments that target pain exactly where it occurs.\nMapping the Brain's Hidden System for Pain\nResearchers at the University of Sydney have revealed a brainstem network that manages pain differently depending on where it occurs in the body. Using placebo pain relief, they discovered a map-like system that fine-tunes pain control for specific regions, such as the face, arms, or legs. The findings could lead to safer and more precise pain therapies that avoid the risks of opioid-based treatments.\nThe brainstem functions as the main communication pathway between the brain and spinal cord, directing signals that control thought, sensation, and survival responses. It also produces most of the brain's vital neurochemicals, making it a central hub for regulating both physical and emotional states.\nPublished in Science, the study used 7-Tesla functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) (one of the most advanced brain scanners available, with only two in Australia) to identify how two major regions of the brainstem coordinate pain relief through placebo responses.\nDr. Lewis Crawford, lead author and research fellow at the School of Medical Sciences and the Brain and Mind Centre, explained, \"This is the first time we've seen such a precise and detailed pain map in the human brainstem, showing us that it tailors pain relief to the specific part of the body that's experiencing it.\"\nThis breakthrough builds on decades of research led by co-author Professor Kevin Keay, Deputy Head of the School of Medical Sciences, who has long studied the brain's role in pain regulation.\nHow the Placebo Effect Reveals the Brain's Pain Control\nTo explore how the brain organizes pain relief, researchers tested 93 healthy volunteers by applying heat to different parts of their bodies. A placebo cream was used on some areas, but scientists secretly lowered the temperature to convince participants that the cream was reducing pain.\nEach participant's heat level was personalized to reach a moderate level of discomfort, based on a scale from 0 (no pain) to 100 (worst pain imaginable), typically between 40 and 50 degrees Celsius.\nWhen the same heat stimulus was later reapplied, participants continued to feel less pain in the areas where the placebo cream had been used, even though the temperature was no longer reduced. About 61 percent reported this effect, a strong indication of genuine placebo-driven pain relief.\nDr. Crawford noted, \"We found that upper parts of the brainstem were more active when relieving facial pain, while lower regions were engaged for arm or leg pain.\"\nPinpointing the Brain's Pain-Relief Centers\nTwo major brainstem regions, the periaqueductal grey (PAG) and the rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM), were identified as central to this system. Each showed distinct patterns of activity depending on where the pain occurred. Upper sections of the PAG and RVM responded to facial pain, while lower sections activated for pain in the limbs.\nAccording to Dr. Crawford, \"The brain's natural pain relief system is more nuanced than we thought. Essentially, it has a built-in system to control pain in specific areas. It's not just turning pain off everywhere; but working in a highly coordinated, anatomically precise system.\"\nA Blueprint for Targeted Pain Therapies\nUnderstanding which brainstem areas are linked to different parts of the body may open new avenues for developing non-invasive therapies that reduce pain without widespread side effects.\n\"We now have a blueprint for how the brain controls pain in a spatially organized way,\" said Professor Luke Henderson, senior author and Professor in the School of Medical Sciences and the Brain and Mind Centre. \"This could help us design more effective and personalized treatments, especially for people with chronic pain in a specific area of their body.\"\nThe study also challenges long-held assumptions about how placebo pain relief works. Instead of relying on the brain's opioid system, experts say a different part of the brainstem -- the lateral PAG -- is not only responsible but works without using opioids and could instead be linked to cannabinoid activity.\n\"Opioid-based pain relief typically activates central areas of the brain and can affect the whole body, whereas the cannabinoid circuit that we identified appears to operate in more targeted regions of the brainstem,\" said Dr. Crawford. \"This supports the idea that cannabinoids may play a role in localized, non-opioid pain control.\"\n\"Knowing exactly where pain relief is happening in the brain means we can target that area or assess whether a drug is working in the right place,\" said Dr. Crawford. \"This could lead to more precise treatments for chronic pain that don't rely on opioids and work exactly where the brain expects pain relief to occur -- a huge step forward for pain management.\"\nStory Source:\nMaterials provided by University of Sydney.

Even moderate physical activity slowed both cognitive decline and the buildup of harmful tau proteins in the brain. The researchers say these results show lifestyle changes can meaningfully delay Alzheimer’s symptoms, especially in early stages.\n- Share:\nAdding even a modest number of steps to your daily routine may help delay the advancement of Alzheimer's disease, especially among those most vulnerable to it, according to new research. In a study published in Nature Medicine, scientists from Mass General Brigham found that greater physical activity was linked to slower cognitive decline in older adults who had higher levels of amyloid-beta, a protein strongly tied to Alzheimer's.\nOn average, people who walked between 3,000 and 5,000 steps a day experienced about three years of delay in cognitive decline. Those who walked 5,000 to 7,500 steps per day saw that delay extend to around seven years. In contrast, participants who were largely inactive showed faster accumulation of tau proteins in the brain, which is associated with Alzheimer's progression, and more rapid declines in thinking skills and daily functioning.\n\"This sheds light on why some people who appear to be on an Alzheimer's disease trajectory don't decline as quickly as others,\" said senior author Jasmeer Chhatwal, MD, PhD, of the Mass General Brigham Department of Neurology. \"Lifestyle factors appear to impact the earliest stages of Alzheimer's disease, suggesting that lifestyle changes may slow the emergence of cognitive symptoms if we act early.\"\nLong-Term Study on Activity and Brain Changes\nResearchers examined 296 individuals aged 50 to 90 who showed no cognitive impairment at the start of the Harvard Aging Brain Study. Participants wore waistband pedometers to track physical activity and underwent PET scans to measure amyloid-beta plaques and tau tangles in the brain. They completed yearly cognitive assessments over a period ranging from two to 14 years (average = 9.3 years), and a subset received additional brain scans to monitor changes in tau over time.\nThe results showed that participants with elevated amyloid-beta who took more daily steps experienced slower cognitive decline and a slower buildup of tau proteins. Statistical modeling indicated that the primary benefit of physical activity came from its association with slower tau accumulation. Among participants with low amyloid-beta levels, there was little evidence of either cognitive decline or tau buildup, and no significant link to activity levels.\nBuilding Cognitive Resilience Through Movement\n\"We are thrilled that data from the Harvard Aging Brain Study has helped the field better understand the importance of physical activity for maintaining brain health,\" said co-author Reisa Sperling, MD, a neurologist at Mass General Brigham and co-principal investigator of the Harvard Aging Brain Study. \"These findings show us that it's possible to build cognitive resilience and resistance to tau pathology in the setting of preclinical Alzheimer's disease. This is particularly encouraging for our quest to ultimately prevent Alzheimer's disease dementia, as well as to decrease dementia due to multiple contributing factors.\"\nThe team plans to further explore which types of physical activity are most beneficial, including how intensity and long-term exercise patterns might influence brain health. They also aim to uncover the biological mechanisms that connect physical activity, tau buildup, and cognitive function. The researchers believe these insights could inform future clinical trials that test whether exercise-based interventions can slow cognitive decline in older adults, particularly those at elevated risk for Alzheimer's.\nEmpowering People to Take Action\n\"We want to empower people to protect their brain and cognitive health by keeping physically active,\" said first-author Wai-Ying Wendy Yau, MD, a cognitive neurologist at Mass General Brigham. \"Every step counts -- and even small increases in daily activities can build over time to create sustained changes in habit and health.\"\nAuthorship: In addition to Yau, Chhatwal and Sperling, Mass General Brigham authors include Dylan R.

The new ingredient, made from refined sunflower flour, delivers excellent nutritional value and a mild flavor. Tests showed strong texture and healthy fat content, suggesting great potential for use in the growing plant-based food sector.\n- Share:\nResearchers at the Institute of Food Technology (ITAL) and the University of Campinas (UNICAMP) in São Paulo, Brazil, working with colleagues from the Fraunhofer IVV Institute in Germany, have developed a new type of food made from sunflower flour that can serve as a substitute for meat.\nThe process begins by extracting oil from sunflower seeds. To make the resulting flour safe and digestible for humans, the outer husks and certain phenolic compounds must first be removed. These elements normally give the flour a darker color and make it harder for the body to absorb nutrients effectively.\nCreating and Testing the Sunflower-Based Burgers\nResearchers prepared two variations of the meat substitute. One was made from flour derived from roasted sunflower grains, while the other used textured sunflower protein. Both formulations were enhanced with tomato powder, spices, and a blend of sunflower, olive, and linseed oils to improve flavor and nutritional value.\nThe team shaped the mixtures into small burger patties and baked them. They then conducted sensory and physicochemical tests to evaluate the products' texture, flavor, and composition. Results revealed that the version made from textured sunflower protein had better consistency and higher levels of protein, along with healthy fats such as monounsaturated fatty acids. It also contained impressive mineral levels, providing 49% of the recommended daily intake of iron, 68% of zinc, 95% of magnesium, and 89% of manganese.\nSustainable, Non-GMO Protein Potential\nThe study, supported by FAPESP, focused on sunflower meal because sunflower oil is already widely used in Europe, and sunflower cultivation is steadily increasing in Brazil. Another advantage is that the plant is not genetically modified, making it an appealing ingredient for consumers seeking non-GMO options.\nSunflower flour also offers a valuable source of plant-based protein, aligning with the growing global demand for sustainable and environmentally friendly food choices.\nMild Flavor and Strong Nutritional Profile\nMaria Teresa Bertoldo Pacheco, a researcher at ITAL's Center for Food Science and Quality and lead author of the paper published in Food Research International, explained that removing the husks and phenolic compounds gives the flour a neutral flavor and aroma. \"It should also be noted that, after removing the husks and phenolic compounds, the flour has a very neutral taste and aroma, especially compared to the various vegetable proteins on the market,\" she said.\nPacheco also highlighted the favorable balance of essential amino acids in the flour, which adds to its nutritional value. From a technological standpoint, she noted that creating a fibrous structure through processes like extrusion is key to achieving a product with a more authentic, meat-like appearance and texture.\nPacheco emphasized that the research contributes valuable insights for maximizing the use of sunflower cultivars while encouraging appreciation for their nutritional benefits. She also praised the collaboration with German researchers, noting that the partnership fostered technical exchanges, knowledge sharing, and opportunities for students and scientists to work together.\nStory Source:\nMaterials provided by Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo.

By restoring the excitability balance in this brain region, they successfully reversed these symptoms in mice. The results point toward targeted neural therapies for emotional disorders. This finding could reshape how anxiety and depression are treated at the circuit level.\n- Share:\nA research team at the Institute for Neurosciences (IN), led by Juan Lerma, has uncovered how a distinct group of neurons in the amygdala -- a region of the brain involved in processing emotions -- contributes to anxiety, depression, and changes in social behavior. The discovery, published in iScience, shows that restoring the balance of neuronal excitability within a precise part of the amygdala can reverse these behavioral changes in mice.\nRestoring Brain Balance to Reverse Anxiety\n\"We already knew the amygdala was involved in anxiety and fear, but now we've identified a specific population of neurons whose imbalanced activity alone is sufficient to trigger pathological behaviors,\" explains Lerma. His team used a genetically modified mouse model that overexpresses the Grik4 gene, which increases the production of GluK4-type glutamate receptors and heightens neuronal excitability. These mice, developed by the same laboratory in 2015, displayed anxiety and social withdrawal similar to symptoms seen in people with conditions such as autism or schizophrenia.\nThe researchers were able to normalize Grik4 expression specifically in neurons located in the basolateral amygdala. This adjustment reestablished normal communication with a group of inhibitory neurons in the centrolateral amygdala known as \"regular firing neurons.\" \"That simple adjustment was enough to reverse anxiety-related and social deficit behaviors, which is remarkable,\" says Álvaro García, the study's first author.\nThe team assessed the animals using electrophysiological recordings and behavioral tests designed to measure anxiety, depression, and social interaction. These tests evaluate traits such as the preference for open or enclosed spaces and interest in unfamiliar mice. Using genetic engineering tools and modified viruses, the scientists precisely corrected the dysfunction in the basolateral amygdala and tracked changes in both neuronal activity and overall behavior.\nWidespread Effects Beyond Genetic Models\nThe researchers then applied the same approach to normal (wild-type) mice that naturally showed higher anxiety levels. The treatment also reduced their anxiety. \"This validates our findings and gives us confidence that the mechanism we identified is not exclusive to a specific genetic model, but may represent a general principle for how these emotions are regulated in the brain,\" Lerma notes.\nSome cognitive deficits, such as problems with object recognition memory, were not corrected, suggesting that other regions like the hippocampus may also play a role in these disorders. Even so, the results open promising new avenues for therapy. \"Targeting these specific neural circuits could become an effective and more localized strategy to treat affective disorders,\" Lerma concludes.\nThis research was supported by the Spanish State Research Agency (AEI) -- Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities, the Severo Ochoa Excellence Program for Research Centers at the Institute for Neurosciences CSIC-UMH, the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), and the Generalitat Valenciana through the PROMETEO and CIPROM programs.\nStory Source:\nMaterials provided by Universidad Miguel Hernandez de Elche.

New research reveals a hidden heart risk\nLong-term melatonin use may secretly strain the heart—raising the risk of failure, hospitalization, and death.\n- Date:\n- November 4, 2025\n- Source:\n- American Heart Association\n- Summary:\n- Long-term melatonin use for sleep problems may come with unexpected heart dangers. Researchers found that chronic users were almost twice as likely to die and 3.5 times more likely to be hospitalized for heart failure. Though melatonin is widely regarded as harmless, experts now urge caution with extended use.\n- Share:\nKey Research Findings\n- A large review of health data from more than 130,000 adults with insomnia found that people who took melatonin for a year or longer were more likely to develop heart failure, be hospitalized for the condition, or die from any cause compared to those who didn't take the supplement.\n- While the study cannot prove that melatonin directly causes these outcomes, the strong association raises important safety questions about long-term use of this popular sleep aid. Researchers emphasize that more studies are needed to fully understand melatonin's impact on heart health and ensure it can be used safely.\nLong-Term Melatonin Use Linked to Higher Heart Failure Risk\nPeople who regularly take melatonin to improve sleep may face serious health risks. A preliminary study presented at the American Heart Association's Scientific Sessions 2025 found that adults with chronic insomnia who used melatonin for a year or longer were more likely to develop heart failure, be hospitalized for heart failure, and die from any cause than those who did not take the supplement. The findings will be discussed at the AHA's annual meeting, taking place Nov. 7-10 in New Orleans, a leading international event for cardiovascular science and clinical research updates.\nMelatonin is a hormone produced by the pineal gland that regulates the body's sleep-wake cycle. Its levels naturally rise in the dark and drop during daylight hours. Synthetic melatonin, which is chemically identical to the natural hormone, is widely used to treat insomnia (difficulty falling and/or staying asleep) and jet lag. In many countries, including the U.S., melatonin supplements can be purchased over the counter. However, because they are not regulated in the U.S., products can differ widely in purity and dosage.\nHow the Study Was Conducted\nResearchers divided participants into two groups based on their medical records. Those who had taken melatonin for at least one year were classified in the \"melatonin group,\" while individuals with no record of melatonin use were placed in the \"non-melatonin group.\"\n\"Melatonin supplements may not be as harmless as commonly assumed. If our study is confirmed, this could affect how doctors counsel patients about sleep aids,\" said Ekenedilichukwu Nnadi, M.D., lead author of the study and chief resident in internal medicine at SUNY Downstate/Kings County Primary Care in Brooklyn, New York.\nInvestigating Heart Failure and Sleep Aid Safety\nAlthough melatonin is marketed as a safe and natural sleep remedy, little evidence exists on its long-term cardiovascular effects. The research team wanted to know whether long-term use could influence heart failure risk in people with chronic insomnia. According to the American Heart Association's 2025 Heart Disease and Stroke Statistics, heart failure occurs when the heart cannot pump enough oxygen-rich blood to sustain the body's organs. The condition affects about 6.7 million U.S. adults.\nTo explore this question, scientists used data from the TriNetX Global Research Network, an international database of de-identified medical records. They reviewed five years of data on adults diagnosed with chronic insomnia who had documented melatonin use for more than a year. Each was matched with another person who also had insomnia but had never used melatonin. Individuals with a previous diagnosis of heart failure or who had been prescribed other sleep medications were excluded.\nThe main analysis found:\n- Among adults with insomnia, those whose electronic health records indicated long-term melatonin use (12 months or more) had about a 90% higher chance of incident heart failure over 5 years compared with matched non-users (4.6% vs. 2.7%, respectively).\n- There was a similar result (82% higher) when researchers analyzed people who had at least 2 melatonin prescriptions filled at least 90 days apart. (Melatonin is only available by prescription in the United Kingdom.)\nA secondary analysis found:\n- Participants taking melatonin were nearly 3.5 times as likely to be hospitalized for heart failure when compared to those not taking melatonin (19.0% vs. 6.6%, respectively).\n- Participants in the melatonin group were nearly twice as likely to die from any cause than those in the non-melatonin group (7.8% vs. 4.3%, respectively) over the 5-year period.\n\"Melatonin supplements are widely thought of as a safe and 'natural' option to support better sleep, so it was striking to see such consistent and significant increases in serious health outcomes, even after balancing for many other risk factors,\" Nnadi said.\nExpert Reactions and Caution From Sleep Researchers\n\"I'm surprised that physicians would prescribe melatonin for insomnia and have patients use it for more than 365 days, since melatonin, at least in the U.S., is not indicated for the treatment of insomnia. In the U.S., melatonin can be taken as an over-the-counter supplement and people should be aware that it should not be taken chronically without a proper indication,\" said Marie-Pierre St-Onge, Ph.D., C.C.S.H., FAHA, chair of the writing group for the American Heart Association's 2025 scientific statement, Multidimensional Sleep Health: Definitions and Implications for Cardiometabolic Health. St-Onge, who was not involved in this study, is a professor of nutritional medicine in the division of general medicine and director of the Center of Excellence for Sleep & Circadian Research in the department of medicine at Columbia University Irving Medical Center in New York City.\nThe study has several limitations. First, the database includes countries that require a prescription for melatonin (such as the United Kingdom) and countries that don't (such as the United States), and patient locations were not part of the de-identified data available to the researchers. Since melatonin use in the study was based only on those identified from medication entries in the electronic health record, everyone taking it as an over-the-counter supplement in the U.S. or other countries that don't require a prescription would have been in the non-melatonin group; therefore, the analyses may not accurately reflect this. Hospitalization figures were also higher than those for initial diagnosis of heart failure because a range of related diagnostic codes may be entered for the hospitalization, and they may not always include the code for a new diagnosis of heart failure. The researchers also lacked information on the severity of insomnia and the presence of other psychiatric disorders.\n\"Worse insomnia, depression/anxiety or the use of other sleep-enhancing medicines might be linked to both melatonin use and heart risk,\" Nnadi said. \"Also, while the association we found raises safety concerns about the widely used supplement, our study cannot prove a direct cause-and-effect relationship. This means more research is needed to test melatonin's safety for the heart.\"\nStudy details, background and design:\n- The study included 130,828 adults (average age of 55.7 years; 61.4% women) diagnosed with insomnia.\n- The study data was from TriNetX, established in 2013, a growing global network of real-world, de-identified patient data available for research.\n- 65,414 participants had been prescribed melatonin at least once and reported taking it for at least a year.\n- A second group of people were examined for comparison (control group) -- those who had never been prescribed melatonin and were matched to the group taking melatonin on 40 factors including demographic information, health conditions and medications.\n- Participants were excluded if they had already been diagnosed with heart failure or had been prescribed other types of sleeping pills such as benzodiazepines.\n- The melatonin and control groups were matched for age, sex, race/ethnicity, heart and nervous system diseases, medications for heart and nervous system diseases, blood pressure and body mass index. Researchers looked at electronic medical records from the five years after the matching date.\n- For the main findings, records were searched for codes related to an initial diagnosis of heart failure. Secondary findings included codes for hospitalization related to heart failure or death.\n- Following the initial analyses, researchers validated the credibility of their findings by conducting a sensitivity analysis. This involved slightly changing the criteria: they required participants in the melatonin group to have filled at least two melatonin prescriptions that were at least 90 days apart. This adjustment aimed to determine whether the extended duration of confirmed melatonin prescriptions influenced the outcomes.\nNote: The study featured in this article is a research abstract.

By analyzing retinal scans alongside genetic and blood data from over 74,000 participants, they found that simpler, less branched eye vessels were linked to higher cardiovascular risk and faster aging.\n- Share:\nThe network of tiny blood vessels within the eyes may offer powerful clues about a person's risk of heart disease and how quickly their body is aging, according to new research from McMaster University and the Population Health Research Institute (PHRI), a joint institute of Hamilton Health Sciences and McMaster.\nPublished in Science Advances on October 24, 2025, the study suggests that simple retinal scans could eventually serve as a non-invasive tool to evaluate both cardiovascular health and biological aging. Such scans may one day help doctors detect problems early and guide preventive care before symptoms appear.\nLinking the Eyes, Genes, and Blood\n\"By connecting retinal scans, genetics, and blood biomarkers, we have uncovered molecular pathways that help explain how aging affects the vascular system,\" says Marie Pigeyre, senior author of the study and an associate professor in McMaster's Department of Medicine.\nAccording to Pigeyre, the eye provides an accessible and unique view into the body's circulatory system. \"Changes in the retinal blood vessels often mirror changes occurring throughout the body's small vessels,\" she explains.\nTo explore these relationships, the researchers analyzed retinal images, genetic profiles, and blood samples from more than 74,000 participants drawn from four large-scale studies: the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging (CLSA), the Genetics of Diabetes Audit and Research Tayside Study (GoDARTS), the UK Biobank (UKBB), and the PHRI Prospective Urban Rural Epidemiological (PURE) study.\nTheir analysis revealed that individuals with simpler and less branched retinal vessels tended to have a higher likelihood of cardiovascular disease. These same individuals also showed biological signs of accelerated aging, including increased inflammation and a reduced lifespan.\nToday, evaluating conditions related to aging such as heart disease, stroke, and dementia usually requires multiple, complex tests. Researchers hope that retinal imaging could one day simplify this process, providing a fast and accessible measure of both aging and cardiovascular risk. However, they note that for now, such scans are just one part of a broader clinical picture that still requires comprehensive testing.\nDiscovering Molecular Clues Behind Aging\nA deeper look at blood biomarkers and genetic data revealed more than simple associations -- it pointed to biological mechanisms that may drive these changes. Researchers identified several key proteins linked to inflammation and vascular aging, suggesting new avenues for drug development.\nAmong the most notable proteins were MMP12 and IgG-Fc receptor IIb, both associated with age-related damage in blood vessels. According to Pigeyre, these molecules could represent promising therapeutic targets.\n\"Our findings point to potential drug targets for slowing vascular aging, reducing the burden of cardiovascular diseases, and ultimately improving lifespan,\" Pigeyre says.\nThe study drew on blood protein biomarker data from the PHRI-led Prospective Urban and Rural Epidemiological study, an international research initiative.\nFunding for the project came from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, the E.J. Moran Campbell Internal Career Research Award from McMaster University, and the Early Career Research Award from Hamilton Health Sciences (HHS).

They discovered that the NOD2 gene’s interaction with a protein called girdin is crucial for maintaining balance. When this connection is lost due to a common mutation, inflammation spirals out of control.\n- Share:\nThe human digestive system relies on two main kinds of macrophages, a type of specialized white blood cell, to maintain intestinal health. One group, the inflammatory macrophages, attacks harmful microbes, while the other, the non-inflammatory macrophages, repairs tissue and promotes healing. In Crohn's disease (a chronic form of inflammatory bowel disease, or IBD), this balance breaks down. When the inflammatory type dominates, the result is persistent inflammation that damages the intestinal wall and causes pain and other symptoms.\nScientists at the University of California San Diego School of Medicine have created a new method that combines artificial intelligence (AI) with cutting-edge molecular biology tools to uncover what determines whether a macrophage becomes inflammatory or restorative.\nTheir research also sheds light on a mystery that has puzzled scientists for decades: how a gene known as NOD2 influences this process. Discovered in 2001, NOD2 was the first gene linked to an increased risk of Crohn's disease.\nMapping the Gut's Genetic Blueprint\nUsing advanced machine learning, the team examined thousands of macrophage gene expression profiles taken from both healthy colon tissue and tissue affected by IBD. This analysis revealed a genetic signature made up of 53 genes that consistently distinguished between aggressive, inflammatory macrophages and those responsible for repairing tissue.\nAmong these 53 genes, one encodes a protein called girdin. The researchers discovered that in non-inflammatory macrophages, a particular part of the NOD2 protein attaches to girdin. This interaction helps keep inflammation under control, removes harmful bacteria, and allows tissue to heal. However, the most common Crohn's disease mutation in the NOD2 gene deletes the section where girdin normally binds. Without that connection, the system becomes unbalanced, tipping toward chronic inflammation.\n\"NOD2 functions as the body's infection surveillance system,\" said senior author Pradipta Ghosh, M.D., professor of cellular and molecular medicine at UC San Diego School of Medicine. \"When bound to girdin, it detects invading pathogens and maintains gut immune balance by swiftly neutralizing them. Without this partnership, the NOD2 surveillance system collapses.\"\nTesting the Discovery in Animal Models\nTo confirm their findings, the scientists compared mouse models of Crohn's disease that lacked the girdin protein with those that still had it. The mice missing girdin developed severe gut inflammation and an altered microbiome, and many died from sepsis, a dangerous condition caused by an uncontrolled immune response that inflames the entire body and harms vital organs.\n\"The gut is a battlefield, and macrophages are the peacekeepers,\" said co-first author Gajanan D. Katkar, Ph.D., assistant project scientist at UC San Diego School of Medicine. \"For the first time, AI has allowed us to clearly define and track the players on two opposing teams.\"\nToward New Treatments for Crohn's Disease\nBy merging AI-based analysis, biochemical research, and animal experiments, the study resolves one of the longest-standing questions in Crohn's disease research. The findings explain how a crucial genetic mutation drives inflammation and could guide the development of new therapies aimed at restoring the lost partnership between girdin and NOD2.\nThe study was published on October 2 in the Journal of Clinical Investigation.\nStory Source:\nMaterials provided by University of California - San Diego.

(That’s a mouthful of buzzwords; we’ve asked Rivian to clarify things a bit more and will update the post if it does.)\nRivian said Tuesday it has secured around $110 million in “external seed capital,” but did not immediately offer any other information about Mind Robotics. “We believe AI-enabled robotics can support a wide range of industrial applications,” Rivian wrote in the letter.\nThe launch of Mind Robotics marks the second time this year that Rivian has created a new standalone company. In March, the company spun out its skunkworks micromobility division into a startup called Also Inc. That new company was funded in part by money from Eclipse, with additional funding from Greenoaks Capital.\nA trademark application for Mind Robotics was submitted to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office on Monday that lists Eclipse partner Jiten Behl as a signatory for the newly-created company, along with Eclipse’s Palo Alto headquarters as the corporate address. Behl did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nIt’s unclear if Rivian employees are moving over to Mind Robotics, like was the case with Also. A Rivian spokesperson declined to say. But the company hinted at the possibility in Tuesday’s letter.\n“With our strong bench of technology talent and an innovation-driven culture, we have been able to identify additional areas of value to accelerate our mission on a wider scale while maintaining Rivian’s focus,” Scaringe wrote\nJoin the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist\nAdd yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

The firm announced Tuesday that partners Alfred Lin and Pat Grady will succeed him as co-Stewards.\nLin joined the storied firm in 2010, where he has led major investments into category-defining companies like Airbnb, DoorDash, and Kalshi. Meanwhile, Pat Grady has been a partner for nearly 19 years and has led Sequoia’s growth-stage investing since 2015, backing iconic companies such as ServiceNow, OpenAI, and the legal AI platform Harvey.\nBotha assumed the highest leadership role in mid-2022 and immediately oversaw a period of upheaval. He took the helm just as the downturn decimated the public markets, severely slashing the valuations of many companies across Sequoia’s portfolio. The firm also wrote off $200 million when its investment in cryptocurrency exchange FTX blew up — a small loss in the bigger scheme of things for Sequoia but a financial hit all the same. Further, in 2023, amid growing political tensions between the U.S. and China and regulatory pressures on both sides, Sequoia spun off its India and China operations into separate independent firms.\nThis year, Sequoia became embroiled in a controversy over partner Shaun Maguire’s comments attacking New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani, calling the politician an “Islamist” who “comes from a culture that lies about everything.” Though Maguire later walked back some of those remarks, they led to a sizable online backlash and debate. In August, Sequoia’s chief operating officer, Sumaiya Balbale, a practicing Muslim, quit over the firm’s decision not to discipline Maguire following his remarks, as first reported by the Financial Times and was discussed last week during an on-stage sit-down with Botha during TechCrunch Disrupt.\nAsked about Balbale, Botha said that as a matter of routine, Sequoia doesn’t comment on personnel matters and that he appreciated everything Balbale had contributed to the firm. Asked about Maguire, Botha said that, “Internally, we celebrate a diversity of opinions, and we need spiky people inside of Sequoia.”\nBotha continued, “We have some of our partners that are very active in philanthropy or some [other] private dealings, and they’re just not as vocal as Shaun might be on social media. And we’ve always honored the right to free speech of each of our individual partners.”\nDuring that same interview, Botha maintained that his role as Senior Steward is not one of absolute command, stressing that other partners hold nearly as much power to steer the firm’s direction. “My title is Steward for a reason — it’s just a notch above ‘usher’ in the dictionary,” he said. Then, in a comment that drew laughter from attendees, he’d added: “It’s mostly because Global Supreme Leader wasn’t available.”\nJoin the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist\nAdd yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

While Sequoia has continued to rack up major investment wins during Botha’s tenure, the leadership change comes as the firm seeks to move past a challenging period into its next phase.\nIndeed, Sequoia, one of world’s most prominent venture capital firms, recently renovated its office, installing a wall where every investor handwrote this reminder: “We are only as good as our next investment.”\nLast week, the firm announced a $750 million early-stage fund targeting Series A startups, as well as a $200 million seed fund.", "summary": "(summarizer_error: 401 Client Error: Unauthorized for url: https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions)"}

The company, which partnered with ChatGPT maker OpenAI in September, reported that traffic from AI tools to its online stores is up 7x since January of this year, and purchases attributed to AI-powered search have increased by 11x.\nAccording to Shopify president Harley Finkelstein, the company’s advantage in the AI era comes from its ability to access the data from millions of merchants and billions of transactions, and its “founder mode” mentality to ship products quickly.\nThis also includes its internal tools, like Scout, which uses AI to help Shopify employees search hundreds of millions of pieces of merchant feedback to make better product decisions.\n“And Scout is just one of many tools we’re developing to turn our own signals, whether it’s support tickets, usage data, reviews, social interactions, or even Sidekick prompts, into fast, informed decisions,” Finkelstein said on the call. “If you take away one thing from this call, let it be this: AI is not just a feature at Shopify.

It’s still obviously very, very early,” he continued. “But what we’re really trying to do is lay the rails for agentic commerce.”\nWhile the company is currently focused on building connections with AI agents, it’s also prepared for the fact that there will be “different permutations” of how agentic commerce will evolve, Finkelstein also noted, which means it needs to be ready for “whichever path wins.”\nJoin the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist\nAdd yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

And happy 35th day of the federal government shutdown, which, as of today, is tied for the longest shutdown in history. But let’s step back for a second, because there’s something these two seemingly unrelated events have in common.\nBack in 2018, two things were constantly in my social media diet: viral videos from WorldStarHipHop.com of people getting into physical fights, and Donald Trump and MAGA influencers instigating Twitter flame wars. Though the content originated from vastly different communities, their most viral posts shared the same qualities: they had to feature a shocking fight, and they had to make their intended audience feel a vicious, vicarious glee about how thoroughly the loser had been beaten up — to the point that no one felt any sympathy toward the loser at all.\nFlash forward seven years, and “WorldStar politics,” as I was calling it back then, has not only entered the mainstream, it’s become an established political norm in America.\nWe still won’t know the results of the hotly contested mayoral race by the time this email’s been sent out, but one thing is for certain. Whether or not he wins, Zohran Mamdani’s skills as a digital communicator — which is kind of like an online influencer, but with much higher societal stakes — did force his primary rival, disgraced former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, to adopt what The New York Times called a “fresh social media persona” to fight Mamdani and his army online. Whether or not Cuomo succeeded at his fresh, new social media persona will only be truly answered once all the votes are tallied. But the fact Cuomo himself had to adapt to internet culture in order to get back into the race underscores a fundamental change in elections and politics. It’s no longer enough to outsource their online presence to an army of 20-something-year-olds churning out memes on their behalf: candidates need to prove that they, themselves, are savvy digital communicators.\nBut it’s not like the 20-something-year-olds won’t lack for work. Although Trump himself is a uniquely singular media figure whose campaigns and presidency have set the standard for how low digital content could go without turning into a complete political liability, his influence has seeped deep into the federal government itself. The MAGA college students and aspiring influencers who watched him run for president in 2016 are now staffing his communications offices across the administration in 2025.\nThe White House is naturally the hub for all MAGA WorldStar content, posting memes from their official accounts meant to both trigger their enemies and satiate their followers — especially when they tie a generally wholesome or anodyne internet trend to a deeply divisive MAGA talking point. (A very brief list of examples: the ASMR migrant deportation video, the AI Ghibli-fied image of Trump deporting a crying woman, the meltdown over the Halo ICE recruitment ads, press secretary Karoline Leavitt and communications director Steven Cheung saying “your mom” in response to a reporter, and so forth.)\nBut the MAGA WorldStar ethos has started seeping into the US government’s official internet presence. WhiteHouse.gov, for instance, recently republished a new presidential history that included photos of perennial MAGA targets: Hunter Biden, Bill Clinton hugging Monica Lewinsky, and Barack Obama in a turban. And as of today, several unfunded federal agencies that play a crucial role in American life have homepage banners explicitly blaming Democrats for the government shutdown — from the Department of Justice and the FDA to the State Department and Health and Human Services. Even now, if you were a SNAP recipient worried about food stamps, and you were to go onto the official US Department of Agriculture website to learn the latest, you’d be met with the following:\n“Senate Democrats have now voted 13 times to not fund the food stamp program, also known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). Bottom line, the well has run dry. At this time, there will be no benefits issued November 01. We are approaching an inflection point for Senate Democrats. They can continue to hold out for healthcare for illegal aliens and gender mutilation procedures or reopen the government so mothers, babies, and the most vulnerable among us can receive critical nutrition assistance.”\nPoliticizing a federal agency’s webpage like this would have been unthinkable in all previous administrations — especially under dire conditions such as a federal government shutdown. But under MAGA WorldStar rules, a .gov webpage is still ultimately a webpage that millions of desperate people will visit. And if you’re a president hell-bent on politicizing the entire federal apparatus to crush your enemies, you might as well treat high-traffic websites you own as a free billboard — and add some shock value to it, too.\nThis week at The Verge:\n- “The government shutdown is delaying new gadgets”, Cameron Faulkner: Confusion, lab shutdowns, and changing rules could lead to even more product delays in the future.\n- “Alleged U Penn hacker claims they’re in it for money, not ‘primarily “anti-DEI”’”, Elizabeth Lopatto: A figure claiming to be one of the hackers says they plan to sell personal data before making it public.\n- “‘Eyes-off driving’ is coming, and we’re so not ready”, Andrew J. Hawkins: Level 3 automation is coming faster than we think. Who will be liable when these systems inevitably make a mistake?\n- “Trump administration charges influencer and congressional candidate over ICE protests”, Stevie Bonifeld: Kat Abughazaleh is charged with conspiracy to impede, as well as assaulting or impeding an ICE officer.\n- “Meta repents again to Republicans in hearing over moderation, while Google stands its ground”, Lauren Feiner: Meanwhile, Democrats just want to hear from FCC Chair Brendan Carr.\n- “Trump says US will restart nuclear weapons testing”, Robert Hart: Something to add to the Nobel Peace Prize submission.\n- “A contentious kids safety bill might be getting gutted — and nobody’s happy”, Lauren Feiner: A centerpiece of the Kids Online Safety Act is rumored to be at risk in the new version.\nAnd now, Recess.\nSpecifically: my recess. Regulator will return on Tuesday, November 25th, and if you’re jonesing for The Verge’s politics and policy coverage in the meantime, there’s a simple hack for that: Go to this webpage, hit “follow”, and presto, it will be on your Verge dot com homepage!\nSee you in two weeks, and if the government is open by then, it’ll be a Thanksgiving miracle.

My purpose? To find out if an AI that sees everything is actually helpful or just plain creepy.\nI let Gemini watch my family for the weekend — it got weird\nGoogle’s Nest cams now use AI to tell you what they see, not just show you. Only sometimes it tells me about things that aren’t there.\nI let Gemini watch my family for the weekend — it got weird\nGoogle’s Nest cams now use AI to tell you what they see, not just show you. Only sometimes it tells me about things that aren’t there.\n“R unpacking items from a box,” read one notification from the Nest camera on a shelf in the kitchen. “Jenni cuts a pie / B walks into the kitchen, washes dishes in the sink / Jenni gets a drink from the refrigerator,” it continued. Sometimes, the alerts sounded like the start of a joke, “A dog, a person, and two cats walk into the room / Two chickens walk across the patio.”\nBut these weren’t jokes. They were mostly accurate descriptions of the goings-on in and around my home, where I’d installed several Google Nest cameras powered by Gemini for Home. This is a new AI layer in the Google Home app that interprets footage from the cameras and — combined with Nest’s facial recognition feature — delivers a written description of the events, including who or what is present, what they are doing, and sometimes even what they’re wearing.\nFor example, now, instead of alerts saying “animal detected on the porch,” I get more descriptive versions telling me that it’s two chickens or one dog. One of those requires immediate action on my part (my husband is not a fan of chickens pooping on our outdoor couch). The other I can ignore. Alerts like the one from the Nest Doorbell at 1AM, which clarifies it’s my son at the front door trying to get in, are less anxiety-inducing than one that just says “person detected.”\nUsing AI to improve the constant barrage of notifications from security cameras is a major upgrade — one that every manufacturer from Ring to Arlo to Wyze is chasing. But how much can we really trust AI to watch over our home?\nWhile Gemini didn’t hallucinate strangers or wildlife in my home as others have reported, its daily summaries — called Home Briefs — in the Google Home app leaned more toward fiction than fact. This is where Gemini AI in the home becomes problematic.\nHow much AI is too much?\nI don’t record my family inside our home. I leave the security to outdoor cameras and set any indoor cameras to switch off when we’re home. But I wanted to give Gemini as much information as possible, so I packed my home with cameras all set to record.\nI installed the new Nest Doorbell 2K, Nest Cam Indoor 2K, and Nest Cam Outdoor 2K (all wired), along with some earlier models compatible with Gemini. This provided surveillance for the major traffic routes inside and outside my house, as well as a large swath of my backyard.\nWhen my husband left the house carrying a shotgun, the alert said he was carrying a garden tool\nGemini’s descriptions and the Home Brief, which are currently in early access, require a $20 per month or $200 per year Google Home Premium Advanced subscription, which also includes 24/7 video recording. The AI only analyzes video, not audio, presumably because it’s using a vision language model for processing. Gemini AI also powers a new feature in the Google Home app called Ask Home, which lets you search recorded video, something also offered by Ring.\nWhen I tested Ring’s version of video search, I found it helpful for keeping tabs on my outdoor cat. Google’s version is better, because it understood the context of my requests. When I asked both to show me the last time chickens were on my porch, Gemini surfaced the most recent sightings, whereas Ring showed me the best match, which was from three days ago.\nBut beyond finding errant animals, I have struggled to find value in this blow-by-blow account of the actions in my home. And yes, it feels creepy.\nThe real-time alerts were mostly accurate and straightforward. I only spotted two major errors: it mistook my dog for a fox in the backyard, and while I had a package sitting on my doorstep waiting to be picked up, anyone approaching the door became someone delivering a package.\nHowever, Gemini appears to have some selective interpretations. I tried to get it to say I was holding a knife — even brandishing it threateningly at the camera. But it would just use words like chopping or carving in the descriptions, no mention of a knife. And it was a big knife!\nWhen my husband left the house carrying a shotgun, the alert said he was carrying a garden tool. It’s unclear whether this is intentional (I’ve reached out to Google), but not identifying weapons seems like a significant oversight for a security-focused system. I would like to know if there is a person with a gun on my porch or wielding a knife in my home.\nGoogle Home needs a way to prioritize urgent alerts over less important ones\nThe daily Home Briefs is where it got weird. Around 8:30 each night, the Google Home app presents its interpretation of the day’s events in a new Activity Tab. You can customize this to focus on things you’re most interested in; for me, that’s animals and teenagers arriving home past curfew.\nThe summaries were about 80 percent correct, with a few less concerning confusions — it said a pizza oven was delivered when I was actually taking it away. But my main issue was with the heavy-handed editorializing in the summaries. Gemini took accurate real-time descriptions of events and turned them into a narrative full of declarative sentences that were simply incorrect.\nFor example, on Halloween, the summary said “Jenni and R were seen interacting with the trick-or-treaters and enjoying the festive atmosphere.” While I did pass out candy, my daughter R wasn’t home. Another summary detailed how my husband and I had spent an enjoyable evening relaxing on the couch along with others. We were home alone.\nHome Brief is an interesting concept. Receiving an end-of-day summary rather than being constantly distracted by alerts throughout the day could help reduce notification fatigue. But it doesn’t mean I can turn off the real-time notifications. I don’t want to wait for a cheerful evening Home Brief to find out about the person who broke into my car at 6 in the morning, or that a fox got into the hen house.\nGoogle Home needs a way to prioritize urgent alerts over less important ones. It also needs to integrate these with my smart home so that I can use specific events — such as chickens on the porch — to trigger automated responses.\nBut making stuff up as the Home Brief did is inexcusable for a system used for home security. Google Home notes that Gemini may make mistakes and offers short clips under the Home Brief so you can check its work, for example, to see that my husband and I were sitting alone in the living room after all. But while Gemini may be able to describe what’s happening, it’s these attempts at interpreting what matters that fall far short.\nWhile I found the AI descriptions for outdoor cameras useful, Gemini’s “intelligence” has not convinced me to start running cameras inside the house. If I’m going to consider letting AI narrate my family’s life, it will need to be a lot more useful and a lot more accurate.\nMost Popular\n- iOS 26.1 lets you tweak Liquid Glass, and it’s out now\n- Coca-Cola’s new AI holiday ad is a sloppy eyesore\n- Making KPop Demon Hunters sound magical meant finding the right harmonies\n- Apple TV’s new name now comes with a new sound\n- Google’s TV Streamer (4K) is down to its best price to date ahead of Black Friday", "summary": "(summarizer_error: 401 Client Error: Unauthorized for url: https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions)"}

At every turn, influencers and the imperatives of content creation have been an inextricable though not always visible part of the National Guard case. The influencers have broadcast their content directly to figures in the administration, they have shaped national policy around “domestic terrorism,” and they have seeped into the legal record itself.\nA few weeks after President Donald Trump first began hinting he would send the National Guard into the midsize American metropolis, a Portland police sergeant wrote an irritated email about three counter-protesters at the ICE building in a southwest neighborhood of the city. The three, the police officer wrote, “continue to be a chronic source of police and medical calls at ICE. Despite repeated advice from officers to stay away from the ICE crowd, they constantly return and antagonize the protesters until they are assaulted or peppersprayed.” He complained that they “even engage in the same trespassing behavior on federal and trolley property as the main protesters.”\nAll three of the so-called counter-protesters were (and still are) extremely active on X, where the conflict had become their bread and butter, a perpetual content farm feeding their social media accounts. A visiting reporter for The Atlantic seemed struck by the ritualized performance on site, as protesters and counter-protesters alike whipped out their phones to film each other. “They all seem to know each other, like high-school sports rivals,” Isaac Stanley-Becker wrote. “Theirs is a social-media beef come to life.” But by the end of September, it was manifestly clear that their content had become fuel for the White House’s strange and expansive war against anti-fascism — Trump’s anti-anti-fascist agenda, if you will. On September 28th, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth issued a memo mobilizing the National Guard into Portland. The city and the state sued immediately.\nWhat was the National Guard supposed to do about internet posts?\nFrom the get-go, the lawsuit has been marked by a struggle over what is real and what is Online. During oral arguments in State of Oregon v. Trump, District Court Judge Karin Immergut sided with what could mostly be considered actual reality. She was perplexed, for instance, when the attorney for the Justice Department argued that National Guard troops were justified in Portland because of the “doxing” of ICE officers and clashes between protesters and counter-protesters. The counter-protesters weren’t federal employees, she pointed out. And what was the National Guard supposed to do about internet posts?\nThe Ninth Circuit panel, which issued a decision staying the temporary restraining order by Immergut, seemed more fixated on Online. Its ruling brought back massive chunks of evidence that the lower court had deemed to be beside the point — incidents dating back to June, the “doxing” of ICE agents on the internet, and an incident involving a “journalist” (who is called a “counter protester” in Portland Police Bureau records, and whose activities consist mainly of posting for 11,000 followers on X and 1,900 on TikTok) being attacked by a “black blocker.”\nPerhaps more alarmingly, the Ninth Circuit opinion is fixated on a period of time from June to July that coincides with the earliest No Kings protests, a time period that the lower court judge thought too far from Trump’s mobilization order to be worth considering.\nThe appeals court’s decision was published on October 20th, the Monday after nationwide No Kings protests that the organizers estimate drew 7 million people. Portland itself saw a turnout several times larger than the massive protests in June, with crowds full of people in inflatable costumes.\nThe whole world got to see Portland looking super goofy right before the Ninth Circuit ruled that it was okay for the president to send in the troops, revising the reality of what might be the biggest political mobilization in American history. And the court’s revisionist universe looked awfully similar to the content being produced by right-wing influencers.\nThe conflict between Trump and reality is long-standing; however, the Ninth Circuit — historically considered a liberal-leaning appeals court — was an unexpected ally in his assault on common sense. But the appeal of the temporary restraining order in State of Oregon v. Trump had landed in front of a three-judge panel with two Trump-appointed judges — a statistically unlikely stroke of bad luck.\nDuring oral arguments, it was painfully obvious which way the Trump judges were going to rule. One of the judges could not stop talking about the year 1792, the Whiskey Rebellion, and rebellion generally (despite the fact that the Trump administration was not actually relying on the rebellion prong of Section 12406 to deploy the National Guard into Portland). The Dallas ICE shooting — over 2,000 miles away from Portland and well outside the jurisdiction of the Ninth Circuit — was mentioned.\nBut most tellingly, the conservative judges on the panel were fixated on events in June, rather than the embarrassingly quiet scene in Portland in the weeks leading up to Trump’s declaration of war against an extremely minor metropolis.\nThis focus on June 2025 was remarkable not just because the Ninth Circuit, in mid-October, was hearing an appeal of an emergency order to stop an emergency deployment of the National Guard to address an emergency, but because that period of supposed anarchy in Portland — about three weeks between June 13th and July 7th when the ICE facility in southwest Portland was “forced to close” — coincided with the first round of nationwide No Kings protests.\nThe first No Kings protest took place on June 14th, drawing approximately 10,000 people across Portland. Unsurprisingly, with that many people out and about, the ICE facility protest — a separate, ongoing protest in another part of town — swelled with people that day. The building may have been “shut down” at the time, but nevertheless, a fed managed to shoot an ER nurse in the eye.\nEven setting aside the increasing violence that ICE was inflicting on the general public across the country, the brutalization of protesters inflamed the situation. As July 4th approached, Indivisible began to plan Independence Day protests around the country. For some reason, it decided not to plan a big one in Portland.\nThe incidents in the record drop off precipitously after July, with the number of protesters dwindling throughout. “Saw 8 people out front and couldn’t even get one of them to flip me the bird” reads one police report cited by the dissent. (The report is dated the same day that Trump publicly compared Portland to “living in hell.”) The Portland police thought the protests had become pathetically “low energy” to the point where it started looking like the feds were scraping at the bottom of the barrel for reasons to be scared.\n“Saw 8 people out front and couldn’t even get one of them to flip me the bird”\nAnd the Ninth Circuit panel’s majority opinion is a litany of barrel-scraping. It describes a woman being arrested because the feds believed she has a gun (no mention of whether a gun is found), protesters unloading “a large quantity of sticks and bats” at a protest (no mention of whether they are ever used), and makes much of ICE agents being “doxed” (no mention of what the National Guard is supposed to do about the doxxings). There is also the mention of a “guillotine” constructed in early September; it is telling that no one — not at the lower court, not in the Ninth Court — has ever asked whether any ICE agents have been guillotined. The whole world knows that the guillotine is a piece of theater, little more than a prop for content creation.\nIf this is all a bad-faith hunt for pretext, that’s alarming enough — but if the Trump judges are truly taking clashes between protesters and counter-protesters seriously, and using them to justify the deployment, the situation is arguably even worse. The National Guard are putatively being deployed to protect federal employees; the obvious conclusion here is that the counter-protesters and right-wing influencers now comprise a paramilitary arm of the federal government that the Trump regime believes is also entitled to protection by the National Guard.\nThat they might possibly be cranks with fewer than 2,000 followers on TikTok is of no consequence — they now have a direct line to the Justice Department, to guns, and to boots on the ground.\nOn October 28th, the rest of the Ninth Circuit agreed to hear the case en banc — a rehearing of the original appeal in front of a larger panel of 11 judges. In the interim, the National Guard has been restrained from deploying into Portland as the case progresses in the lower court.\nDuring a three-day trial, it was revealed that the Guard had been briefly deployed on October 4th, in contravention of the restraining order. (“We’ll talk later about whether that’s contempt,” the judge said in court.)\nAt trial, a Portland police commander described the feds’ use of force against protesters as “startling”; the reality that he saw on the ground did not seem to justify it. The DOJ begged to differ — but feds on the witness stand couldn’t quite bring themselves to endorse Trump’s apocalyptic vision of Portland. “I do not agree with the statement that Portland is burning down,” said a federal law enforcement official in court. He, presumably, lives in reality. However, his boss, Donald Trump, does not.\nA couple of days after the trial wrapped, Judge Immergut granted a preliminary injunction against the National Guard deployment.\nFrom the Truth Social post that spawned the deployment of the Guard to the content factory that produced much of the “violence” described by the Ninth Circuit, the Portland National Guard case is simply Way Too Online. The law should, ideally, be based on real life and govern real life. But Portland has become a recursive loop of posting, a manufacturing hub for national policy as envisioned by clout-chasers.\nThe area in front of the ICE building is crawling with influencers. There’s Katie Daviscourt, who currently has over 269,000 followers on X — up nearly 70,000 since the Portland National Guard order. There’s Chelly Bouferrache, who goes by “Hunnybadgermom,” who now has over 62,000 followers on X, twice as many as she did in September. Then there’s Rhein Amacher, who has 11,000 followers, up from around 3,000 in August. Amacher has not found the same degree of success as the other two, and therefore has fewer archives of his X profile. He was also passed over by the feds when they granted Daviscourt and Bouferrache special access to the ICE facility in October.\nBut it was Amacher, he of 1,900 TikTok followers, who ended up becoming justification for the deployment of the National Guard into Portland — albeit without his name attached. In late September, federal law enforcement had complained to the local police department about a clash between Amacher and a protester, sending along a video while calling Amacher a “journalist” in their report. The local police, on the other hand, repeatedly identified him as a “counter-protester” in their reports. The journalistic profession is hardly sacrosanct; however, the semantic difference is still significant: a protester fighting a journalist sounds bad, but a protester fighting a counter-protester sounds like a regrettable inevitability. Yet despite his repeated appearances in the Portland Police Bureau’s reports as a “counter-protester,” the appellation “journalist” made it into the lower court decision that had restrained the National Guard; it then appeared in the Ninth Circuit appeals court decision that had undone the restraining order.\nThe Ninth Circuit didn’t just casually quote the lower court decision, it pulled an entirely fresh quote out of the record, describing the clash as “a ‘black blocker’ assaulting a journalist with a large sword or stick.” The incident, alleged to have taken place on September 19th, is curiously missing from the influencer’s TikTok, which is largely composed of poorly edited and confusing videos of protesters yelling or being beaten by the feds, much to Amacher’s gleeful amusement. His TikTok profile states, “Donald J. Trump for President 2024 🇺🇲.” Many of his posts identify protesters by name, calling them “antifa” or mocking them for being trans. One post calls a protester a “skirt-wearing fraud”; another zooms in on a group of random people in a parking lot, calling the assembly “a herd of wild they/thems.”\nEven a permissive definition of “journalist” would have trouble being applied to Amacher. He is, at best, a content creator, and one at the junior varsity level at that. Although his following exploded after Trump promised to send troops to “War Ravaged” Portland, it’s other influencers — like Daviscourt — who’ve gained the most ground in the days and weeks since.\nDaviscourt, who writes for the far-right website The Post Millennial, was allegedly beaten by “antifa” on September 30th, just a couple of days after Hegseth’s memo to mobilize the National Guard.\nDaviscourt did a round of press on Fox News with apparent bruising on her face. She was even invited to the White House later for a “roundtable” on “antifa.”\nThe Portland police had more of a dour take on Daviscourt, identifying her as one of the three counter-protesters “that continue to be a chronic source of police and medical calls” in an internal email. (Bouferrache and Amacher are the other two.)\nSortor went on to publicly attack the Portland Police Bureau for being ‘Antifa-infiltrated’\nBut the police very soon had much bigger fish to fry, as out-of-state influencers swooped in to get in on the content-rich environs of the Portland ICE facility. On October 2nd, local police arrested Nick Sortor of Washington, DC, on suspicion of disorderly conduct. After Sortor was released the following morning, he told his 1.2 million followers on X that he had spoken to Attorney General Pam Bondi. (Bondi later opened an investigation into the Portland police.) Sortor, who was also invited to Trump’s roundtable on “antifa,” went on to publicly attack the Portland Police Bureau for being “Antifa-infiltrated,” an allegation that the Trump administration appears to be taking seriously — the word of an influencer being, apparently, much weightier than the thin blue line.\n“Claims of the bureau’s alleged allegiance to antifa may come as a surprise to Portlanders,” noted The Oregonian dryly, reminding its readership that during 2020 the PPB had “filed 6,000 use of force reports” and “arrested nearly 1,000 left-wing protesters.”\nOf course, those who read The Oregonian do not need to be reminded how stupid it is to call the Portland police antifa. Locals like District Court Judge Karin Immergut or Ninth Circuit Judge Susan P. Graber are perfectly aware of how ridiculous that assertion is.\nAnd it is locals like Immergut and Graber who are the most appalled by Trump’s attempt to send the National Guard into Portland. “The President’s determination was simply untethered to the facts,” Immergut wrote when issuing her temporary restraining order. Immergut was appointed to the bench by Trump in 2019, but she’s lived in Portland since at least the 1990s; it is hard to convince a local that they live in a “War Ravaged” apocalypse when they saw no such thing while driving to work.\n“Given Portland protesters’ well-known penchant for wearing chicken suits, inflatable frog costumes, or nothing at all when expressing their disagreement with the methods employed by ICE, observers may be tempted to view the majority’s ruling, which accepts the government’s characterization of Portland as a war zone, as merely absurd,” wrote Graber in her dissent from the Ninth Circuit decision to stay Immergut’s TRO. Graber once served on the Oregon Supreme Court; the naked bike ride protesting the National Guard deployment wouldn’t be the only naked bike ride she’s witnessed.\nIt is locals like Immergut and Graber who are the most appalled by Trump’s attempt to send the National Guard into Portland\nBut touching grass has been absent from the political system for quite some time. The White House’s elevation of the clout-chasing perpetuated by Daviscourt and Sortor can be best understood as a post hoc justification of the National Guard deployment, as well as being part of its ongoing anti-anti-fascist crusade.\nAn antifa roundtable in Washington, DC, can be happily free from the encroachments of real life. However, an appeals court decision — even if written by a judge a thousand miles away from Portland — begins to sound a little strange when it joins the Trump administration in its assault on reality.\nAside from the brief illegal deployment of the National Guard back in early October, the Trump administration appears to be respecting judicial rulings on the matter. The Ninth Circuit vacated the original panel’s ruling when it voted to rehear the case; things are looking hopeful for Portland. But the Ninth Circuit is but one front in the war on reality, and it’s one that is subordinate to the whims of the Trump-controlled Supreme Court.\nIt’s notable that Amacher became a “journalist” in the Ninth Circuit because the feds called him one while sharing a video with the Portland police. Content, it seems, has a transmutative effect, and the real war is happening on the ground — a war that isn’t fought with rocks or fake guillotines or less-lethal munitions or tear gas, but with smartphones pointed at smartphones pointed at smartphones. And as more and more content is manufactured at the ICE building — tirelessly captured by actors highly motivated to catch the eyes of Donald Trump, of Stephen Miller, of Pam Bondi — the legal record in the lawsuits around the regime’s war on antifa will continue to warp and decay. And if a pack of internet weirdos can successfully paint the Portland Police Bureau as antifa domestic terrorists, 7 million Americans in frog costumes are just as vulnerable.\nMost Popular\n- iOS 26.1 lets you tweak Liquid Glass, and it’s out now\n- Coca-Cola’s new AI holiday ad is a sloppy eyesore\n- Making KPop Demon Hunters sound magical meant finding the right harmonies\n- Apple TV’s new name now comes with a new sound\n- Google’s TV Streamer (4K) is down to its best price to date ahead of Black Friday", "summary": "(summarizer_error: 401 Client Error: Unauthorized for url: https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions)"}

The latest 14-inch MacBook Pro that debuted in October 2025 features the M5 processor, its fastest and most efficient yet, and it’s already over $50 off at Amazon. But if you don’t need the latest tech, Walmart is still selling the M1 MacBook Air that has long since been discontinued (yet is still supported with updates). It’s tough to beat the value at just $599, which is $50 off its previous low — a far cry from the $2,499 starting price of the 16-inch MacBook Pro with M4 Pro.\nThe best deals on MacBooks right now\nApple’s latest MacBook Air and Pro laptops are on sale, as is the newest Mac Mini.\nApple’s latest MacBook Air and Pro laptops are on sale, as is the newest Mac Mini.\nPurchasing a new MacBook can be complicated if you’re trying to figure out what specs you need, but finding a deal on a relatively speedy model is surprisingly easy. Apple has recently shaken things up by increasing the starting RAM for several models, creating more options than ever before (and thus, more opportunities for discounts). For example, the MacBook Air 13 with Apple’s M4 chip, 16GB of RAM, and a 256GB SSD is down to $799 ($200 off) at Best Buy.\nAlthough Macs may not get perpetual discounts, it’s not uncommon to see various models discounted by as much as $800. Alternatively, purchasing refurbished options directly from Apple is another way to save money without waiting for the changing deal winds to blow your way. It’s also the only option to find certain configurations of older models as Apple continues to move forward on newer releases. Apple’s refurbished store provides a one-year warranty on all products, and generally offers discounts of up to 15 to 20 percent off the price of a new unit.\nBut if you want to buy new and you’re looking to save whatever you can, here are the best MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, and Mac Mini deals available.\nFeatured Products\nThe best MacBook Air deals\nM1 MacBook Air\nThe 2020 M1 MacBook Air was considered Apple’s entry-level laptop before the M3 model’s arrival prompted Apple to stop selling it directly in its online and brick-and-mortar stores. It’s still a great choice if you want a MacBook for non-intensive productivity work, especially given that it features a comfortable keyboard, an excellent trackpad, and all-day battery life. For many people, the M1 Air still ticks the right boxes when it comes to performance and price, but since newer Mac laptops handily outperform it, you won’t find it in our guide to the best laptops.\nThe base MacBook Air with the M1 chip comes with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. It’s becoming harder to find in new condition, but Walmart has committed to keeping it around for the foreseeable future and is currently discounting it to $599 ($50 off), which is its lowest price to date.\n2020 MacBook Air with M1 (256GB)\nThe 2020 MacBook Air has been discontinued but remains a great value. It comes outfitted with the company’s original M1 chip in one of three different colors (silver, space gray, and gold).\nM2 MacBook Air\nThe M2 MacBook Air is a slim, lightweight laptop with a 1080p webcam and a handy magnetic charger that frees up one of its two USB-C ports. Given that it’s slightly newer than the M1, it delivers better performance, but if you want to really futureproof your laptop, we recommend spending slightly more for a laptop that has a faster, newer processor.\nStill here for the M2? It has some downsides to be on the lookout for, including slower storage in the base 256GB configuration, and the notch cut-out in its screen is divisive (Apple shows no signs of ditching it, either).\nThe M2-powered MacBook Air from 2022 seems to be on its way out, with availability waning; however, you can still get the 13-inch M2 model with 16GB of RAM, 256GB of storage, and an eight-core GPU in select colors at Best Buy starting at $799, which unfortunately isn’t a discount. The 15-inch MacBook Air M2 is also still available in short supply at some retailers for its original MSRP, though at this point, you’d be better off going with a discounted M4 model.\nThe 2022 MacBook Air is a thin, lightweight device powered by Apple’s M2 chip. The M2 model touts an improved 1080p webcam and a better display than its predecessor while retaining features like long battery life and MagSafe charging.\nM3 MacBook Air\nApple’s updated entry-level laptops arrived in 2023 in both 13.6- and 15.3-inch variants simultaneously, bringing with them slightly faster performance over the previous generation and a slate of minor upgrades. Apple added Wi-Fi 6E, for one, along with an additional Thunderbolt port that allows you to use two external displays when the lid is closed. They also offer 18 hours of battery life and have a MagSafe charging port. Apple discontinued the M3 MacBook Air with 8GB of RAM in 2024 and now considers the 16GB / 256GB model as the starting configuration.\nThe entry-level 13-inch M3 MacBook Air configuration with an 8-core GPU, 16GB of RAM, and a 256GB SSD is tough to find in stock. However, you can get the 24GB RAM / 512GB SSD model with a 10-core GPU for $1,093 in select colors at Best Buy.\nAs for the M3-powered 15-inch MacBook Air, you can buy it in select colors at Best Buy with 512GB of storage, 16GB of RAM, and a 10-core GPU for $1,093 ($207 off). If you need even more memory, the model with 512GB of storage, 24GB of RAM, and a 10-core GPU is available for $1,124 ($526 off) at Best Buy.\n13-inch MacBook Air with M3 (2024)\nThe MacBook Air M3 is a jack-of-all-trades, with a balanced combination of performance and power efficiency. It also now supports dual displays with the lid closed, and the storage speed is noticeably faster. You don’t need to think about if this laptop will meet your needs — it just will.\nApple MacBook Air M3 (15-inch)\nThe 15-inch MacBook Air is also equipped with Apple’s M3 chip. It features a larger display and better speaker array than the 13-inch MacBook Air M3. As of October 2024, it starts with 16GB of RAM instead of the original 8GB when it launched.\nM4 MacBook Air\nIn March, Apple released an updated MacBook Air, which comes in both a 13- and 15-inch configuration with an M4 processor. Interestingly, the latest Air starts at a lower price than the prior model, yet it offers slightly faster performance and twice as much base RAM at 16GB. It can also connect to two external monitors with the lid open, it comes in a fresh sky blue color, and features the 12-megapixel Center Stage webcam from the latest MacBook Pro. Needless to say, there’s a lot to like.\nBoth the 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Airs are currently receiving some sizable discounts. You can pick up the 13-inch base model with a 10-core CPU, eight-core GPU, 16GB of RAM, and 256GB of storage on sale at Amazon in select colors starting $799 ($200 off). If you prefer the larger 15-inch model, the entry-level configuration with a 10-core GPU, 16GB of RAM, and 256GB of storage is on sale for $999.99 at Amazon and B&H Photo, which at $200 off is a great deal.\n13-inch MacBook Air (M4, 16GB RAM, 256GB SSD)\nPowered by the M4 chip, Apple’s latest 13-inch MacBook Air is faster than its predecessor and offers double the base RAM. It can also now connect to two external displays with the lid open and features an improved Center Stage webcam.\n15-inch MacBook Air (M4, 16GB RAM, 256GB SSD)\nApple’s 15-inch MacBook Air with the M4 chip is nearly identical to its 13-inch sibling. However, it includes a six-speaker sound system, not four, and your choice of a free 35W Dual USB‑C Port Compact Power Adapter or 70W USB‑C Power Adapter.\nThe best MacBook Pro deals\nDuring its “Scary Fast” event in 2023, Apple announced MacBook Pros that use M3 processors — including a 14-inch model that replaced the 13-inch M2 model. Apple followed the M3 models up with M4-based machines in October 2024, but the last-gen M3 models can often be the better bargain, as they’re still relatively easy to find and receive steeper discounts.\nM3 and M3 Pro MacBook Pro\nThe entry point into the MacBook Pro world is a MagSafe-equipped MacBook Pro that uses the existing 14-inch design and slightly pares it down. The 14-inch M3 MacBook Pro has the same 3024 x 1964 resolution display and 120Hz refresh rate as its pricier siblings, and in addition to a MagSafe charging port, it has an SD card slot and HDMI port. However, it starts with just 8GB of RAM and lacks the third USB-C / Thunderbolt port found on the M3 Pro and M3 Max models (as well as Thunderbolt 4 speeds).\nThe M3 MacBook Pro may be a bit of an odd middle child in some ways, but it’s still a very good laptop — especially if you can find a deal that puts more price distance between the M3 model and the M3 Pro version. Availability for the base model with 8GB and 512GB of storage seems to be waning as Apple standardizes 16GB of RAM across its lineup.\nWe’re having trouble finding configurations of the M3 and M3 Pro models in stock. Best Buy has the 14-inch model with 18GB RAM / 512GB SSD for $1,614.99 ($284 off) on clearance in silver. One of Best Buy’s last remaining 16-inch models with the M3 Pro has 18GB RAM / 512GB SSD in space black for $2,039 ($360 off).\n14-inch MacBook Pro with M3 (2023)\nApple’s previous-gen 14-inch laptop powered by the M3 processor uses a similar design to the pricier 14-inch MacBook Pro with Apple’s Pro- / Max-series chips but is offered at a lower price with similar ports and less RAM.\nM4 and M4 Pro MacBook Pro\nApple released the M4-series MacBook Pro in November 2024. Notably, the base 14-inch M4 MacBook Pro is the first to launch with 16GB of RAM — double the previous generation’s starting memory — and 512GB of storage for the same $1,599 starting price as the last-gen model. It also picks up a third Thunderbolt 4 port, which is positioned on the right side and supports dual external monitors while the lid is open. Also new in this model is an upgraded 12-megapixel webcam that supports Center Stage and a new Desk View feature, plus the option to add a nano-texture display for an extra $150. It’s also available in space black.\nThe 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pro models with M4 Pro and M4 Max chips also received additional RAM, bringing them up to 24GB. They start with 512GB of storage, too, and retail for $1,999 and $2,499, respectively. While the total port selection hasn’t changed compared to their respective M3 Pro and M3 Max counterparts, you’ll get faster Thunderbolt 5 ports on these more substantial models. That’s in addition to the SD slot, dedicated full-sized HDMI port, and 3.5mm jack. They also have the upgraded 12-megapixel Center Stage webcam with Desk View and the optional nano-texture display option.\nMany variations of the M4 MacBook Pro with different screen and processor configurations are on sale right now. For example, you can currently pick up the base 14-inch MacBook Pro M4 with 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD at Amazon for $1,399.99 ($200 off). Meanwhile, the 24GB / 512GB variant with an M4 Pro chip (12-core CPU / 16-core GPU) is down to $1,779 ($220 off) at Amazon.\nThe base 16-inch MacBook Pro is also on sale with an M4 Pro chip, 24GB of RAM, and 512GB of storage for $2,234.51 (about $264 off) at Amazon.\nApple MacBook Pro 14 (2024, M4)\nThe entry-level MacBook Pro with M4 starts with 16GB of RAM — double that of its predecessor — and a 512GB SSD for the same starting price of $1,599. It also gets a third USB-C / Thunderbolt 4 port and comes in a new space black option.\n14-inch MacBook Pro with M4 Pro\nThe 14-inch MacBook Pro with a 12-core / 16-core M4 Pro chip starts with 24GB of RAM — a 6GB increase over the prior generation. It also has a 512GB SSD, three Thunderbolt 5 USB-C ports, an optional nano-texture display, and a 12-megapixel webcam.\nApple MacBook Pro 16 (2024, M4 Pro)\nThe 16-inch MacBook Pro with M4 Pro starts with 24GB of RAM and offers more computing cores (14 for the CPU and 20 for the GPU) compared to the 14-inch model. It also picks up Thunderbolt 5 ports and a new 12-megapixel Center Stage camera.\nM5 MacBook Pro\nApple’s latest revision of the 14.2-inch MacBook Pro adds the M5 processor. The generational leap will be felt most by those who have an older MacBook Pro, not those upgrading from last year’s M4, unless you use specific AI apps that tap into the chip’s new Neural Accelerators. As for other design changes and upgrades to the inside and outside of this MacBook Pro, there really aren’t any major ones to note; in fact, it’s so similar to the M4 model that our reviewer Antonio Di Benedetto had to write “M5” on a sticky note just to be able to tell them apart. That being said, it’s still an amazing laptop, one that’s just now starting to get minor discounts.\nThe 14.2-inch base model with the M5 processor, 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage is $1,536.50 through Amazon (about $63 off). This is currently the best price on the web, as other retailers are selling it for $1599.\nMacBook Pro 14-inch (M5, 2025)\nApple’s 14-inch M5 MacBook Pro has a faster 10-core CPU and 10-core GPU that’s up to 3.5x faster at AI tasks. The new laptop also has faster memory bandwidth.\nThe best Mac Mini deals\nThe newest Mac Minis in town are the M4-based models, which arrived late last year. Apple reduced the horizontal footprint of its desktop and paired it with its M4 chipset and 16GB of RAM, which is double that of the previous generation and brings it in line with other base model Macs from 2024. That makes Apple’s newest desktop computer a tremendous value.\nM4 and M4 Pro Mac Mini\nDeals on the newest Mac Mini are a bit easier to come by now than they were at launch, which is good since the outgoing M2 model is becoming more difficult to find. The M4 Mac Mini starts with an M4 processor, 16GB of RAM, and 256GB of storage for $599. That’s an incredible value for a tiny desktop computer that can rival the Mac Studio and Mac Pro when it comes to certain tasks, including light gaming, 4K video editing, and 3D modeling. Vertically, the M4 Mac Mini is a fair bit thicker than the last-gen M2 model at 2 inches tall, yet it measures a mere 5 inches wide and 5 inches deep.\nIn addition to the odd decision to place the power button on its underside, Apple moved the 3.5mm headphone jack and two of its five USB-C / Thunderbolt 4 ports to the front. The rear features an additional three Thunderbolt ports, HDMI-out, and a gigabit ethernet port. You can also get the Mac Mini with an M4 Pro chipset starting at $1,399, which comes with faster Thunderbolt 5 storage and the option to upgrade to 10-gigabit ethernet for another $100.\nRight now, you can get the base Mac Mini at Amazon with an M4 chip, 16GB of RAM, and a 256GB SSD for $499 ($10 off). If you need more storage, you can step up to the version with 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD for around $689 ($110 off) at Amazon.\nMeanwhile, the base M4 Pro model with 24GB of RAM and 512GB of storage is on sale for around $1,269 ($130 off) at Amazon and $1,309 B&H Photo.\nApple Mac Mini (M4)\nThe latest Mac Mini features Apple’s upgraded M4 chips and a smaller build than the prior model. Each configuration now starts with 16GB of RAM and includes five total Thunderbolt ports, gigabit ethernet, HDMI, and a 3.5mm jack.

{"title": "The best robot vacuums we&#8217;ve tested for 2025", "url": "https://www.theverge.com/22997597/best-robot-vacuum-cleaner", "published": "2025-11-04T19:18:35-05:00", "source": "The Verge", "id": "0515355f539a352d", "theme": "tech", "cleaned_text": "Robot vacuums are impressive devices that will clean your floors well and — thanks to bigger batteries and better robot brains — rarely get tired of doing their job. Over the last few years, they have gone from being utilitarian devices that sweep your floor to full-fledged home robots that can vacuum and mop your home and then trundle off to clean themselves to be ready for the next run.\nThe best robot vacuums we’ve tested for 2025\nWe picked the best bots you can buy right now.\nWe picked the best bots you can buy right now.\nI’ve been testing robot vacuums for seven years and have run over 70 robot vacuums all over my house. These are my top picks if you’re looking for the best: a robot vacuum that can do it all with limited intervention from you.\nAlong with my top picks, I have options to fit specific needs, such as mopping or besting pet hair. The good news is that there are a lot of great options. Whether you have a 3,000-square-foot home and three shaggy dogs or a small, stylish apartment you share with a goldfish, there’s a robot vacuum to suit your needs.\nFeatured Products\nWhat I look for\nI test robot vacuums constantly. At any time, there are seven or eight of these busy little bots roaming my floors. Alongside everyday use, I put them through a gauntlet of specific tests. This includes testing object detection and avoidance with phone chargers, socks, a pencil, and fake pet poop. I throw in Cheerios or popcorn to see if they know to vacuum that up rather than avoid it. I also run them over oatmeal and flour to see how well they pick up fine debris and have them tackle both thick and low-pile carpets. I watch to see how they handle rug tassels, skinny chair legs, and room transitions.For mopping prowess, I test them on hardwood and tile floors with dried milk, fresh OJ, and ketchup. I monitor how quickly they fill up their bin / auto-empty dock and how efficiently they use water and clean their mop pads.I also set schedules, hook them up to voice assistants, and play with any advanced features in the app. I evaluate how well they map and how easy the maps are to edit and use, as well as test and unique features such as home security camera capabilities, AI cleaning programs, and auto-mop removal.\nIt’s not all about suction. In my testing, the brush is also a big factor in how well a robot will clean your floors. A large rubber roller brush is much better than a small bristle brush at picking up debris. It’s also less prone to getting tangled up with hair. Two brushes are better than one, and a brush housing that has some flexibility — so it can move with the contours of the floor — is also more effective.It’s hard to find a robot vac that doesn’t have some form of mopping, but not all mops are created equal. I looked for mopping bots that could get up dried-on stains, like milk and ketchup, and scrub up small wet spills without messing themselves up. Oscillating, spinning, or vibrating mop pads clean better than bots that just drag a wet rag around, but the new self-cleaning roller mops that are beginning to appear are even more effective. Auto-carpet sensing is also important since it prevents the robot from accidentally mopping your rug.\nA big bin means you don’t need to empty it as often. The largest I’ve seen is 800ml, but anything over 500ml is decent. With many bots now pulling double duty as mopping robots, plus the popularity of self-empty dock / charging bases, it’s getting harder to find small robot vacs with big bins. But they’re worth considering — especially if you have carpets and pets. I love self-empty docks, but sometimes you don’t have space for them, and if you like your robot to be out of sight (living under your bed or sofa), you’ll want a big bin and no dock.Self-emptying docks are becoming standard now and coming down in price (thankfully). A self-empty dock turns the charging base for your robot into a motorized emptying station that sucks out the dirt from its bin. (Warning: this process can be loud!) This saves you from having to pull out the bin after every few runs and empty it yourself. Instead, you’ll have to replace the bag (and buy new ones) when it gets full, generally about once a month. Many robots now have a self-empty dock option you can add later, although buying them together is generally cheaper.\nAnother nice-to-have feature, AI-powered obstacle detection helps your robot “intelligently” detect and avoid clutter (and a potential poop apocalypse if it encounters pet waste). These models use cameras (worth noting) to see objects in their path and onboard processors to “decide” how to approach them based on what they see. All AI is not created equal, however, and some are much better at this than others. The end result is that robot vacuums with AI detection are less likely to get stuck when cleaning, so you’re more likely to come home to a clean floor rather than a beached bot.A robot that maps your house will get into every nook and cranny better than one that bumps and rolls around. Mapping also lets you send the robot to clean specific rooms rather than the whole space and add virtual walls to prevent your bot from going where you don’t want it to. These are crucial if you have delicate objects or areas in your home that regularly trap robots. Most robots use variations on simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) technology, such as lidar or vSLAM.\nA good app has easy controls to stop and start your vacuum, scheduling options (including do-not disturb hours), plus good mapping features. Nice-to-have features are room-specific cleaning and settings (so you can tell your vacuum to clean the kitchen or have it mop and vacuum the kitchen but only vacuum the living room). My biggest frustration with apps is maps that are fiddly to update and / or crash and must be rebuilt constantly. Most vacuums now have voice control (see FAQs), but some offer more in-depth control, such as telling Alexa to have the robot clean twice under the dining room table.\nNearly all robot vacuums can “recharge and resume” — take themselves back to their dock when they’re low and recharge before picking up where they left off. But a vacuum with at least 120 minutes of runtime (180 is ideal) will clean the whole house in one go. If it takes too long, noisy robots that are constantly running will get shut off by annoyed family members who aren’t about to clean the room for you.Robot vacuums are quite an investment, and it’s important to be able to buy replacement parts to keep them going for longer and have access to good support in case your robot has a serious issue.\nBest robot vacuum\nRoborock S8 MaxV Ultra\nThe Good\n- Excellent vacuuming performance\n- Good sonic mopping\n- Extendable side brush gets into corners better\n- Very good app\nThe Bad\n- Dock is still quite ugly\n- Mopping tray is hard to clean\n- Expensive\nDustbin capacity: 270ml / Self-empty dock option: Yes / Auto-refill mop option: Yes / Mop lift: Yes, 20mm / Mop washing: Hot water and heated air drying / Mapping: Yes, lidar / AI-powered obstacle detection: Yes / Suction power: 10,000Pa / Remote check-in: Yes / Keep-out zones: Yes, virtual / Brush style: Dual rubber / Works with: Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Siri Shortcuts, Apple Home via Matter\nRoborock’s S8 MaxV Ultra ($1,799.99) is an exceptional vacuum cleaner and a very good mop. Its dual rubber roller brushes and 10,000Pa suction make it great on carpets; its sonic mopping is very good on hard floors, and its improved AI-powered obstacle detection means it will most likely get the job done without getting trapped or derailed.\nThe S8 MaxV Ultra is the best in the category of “hands-free” robot vacs, bots that do virtually everything for you: empty their bins, refill their mop tanks, and clean and dry their mop pads. Roborock invented this category with the S7 MaxV Ultra and has been steadily improving it.\nThat’s the big selling point here; this bot is basically hands-free. Fill the S8 MaxV Ultra’s clean water tank and empty its dirty water once a week and change out the dust bag every couple of months. The robot will take care of the rest.\nFor $100 more, you can dispense with dealing with the water tanks entirely and buy the Refill & Drainage System model. This lets you plumb the charging base directly into your home’s water supply. I’ve not tested this on the Roborock, but my experience with the SwitchBot S10 with the same feature leads me to recommend this option if you can swing it.\nThe S8 MaxV Ultra comes with excellent AI-powered obstacle detection, bringing back the camera it last had on the S7 MaxV Ultra. It’s not quite as good as Roomba’s obstacle detection — it sometimes confused a pile of Cheerios for a charging cable and avoided them — but it’s much better than the Roborocks that rely on non-camera obstacle detection. It deftly navigates around most household clutter, allowing you to get the job done without having to tidy up.\nRoborock has caught up to Roomba on cleaning prowess, and the S8 MaxV Ultra’s dual rubber brushes and 10,000Pa of suction power tackled the pet hair on my fluffy carpet and demolished my oatmeal test.\nIt also did a better job at mopping than Roomba’s mopping bots, though not quite as well as the Narwal Freo X Ultra or Dreame X40 Ultra, though it’s a better vacuum than either.\nIts sonic mopping system — which vibrates its mop pad 4,000 times a minute — ably simulated scrubbing and wiped out my OJ and ketchup tests, though I did have to set it to deep scrub. Plus, the addition of a side mop and flexi-arm brush that extends from the bot helped with cleaning edges and corners.\nRoborock’s mobile app is easy to use and comes with a laundry list of features and customizations that give you ample control over your cleaning. The S8 MaxV Ultra also has a built-in voice assistant, which makes getting the bot to clean the mess your kid made after dinner as easy as saying, “Rocky, clean here.”\nRoborock also sells the S8 Max Ultra (no V) for $1,599.99. It has the same cleaning hardware as the MaxV but no camera, so its obstacle detection will not be as good. However, you also don’t have to worry about a camera in your house. It has a lower 8,000Pa of suction and lacks a voice assistant, too, which makes it seem overpriced since it’s currently only a couple hundred dollars less than the MaxV.\nThere are several great vacuum / mop hybrids in this guide. Of them, the S8 MaxV Ultra is the best at vacuuming and obstacle detection, and it’s a very good mop. It can also do both in one run, as it can lift its mop 20mm, which will clear all but the highest-pile rugs. If you have a lot of those, go for the Dreame X40, with its automatic mop removal. Its vacuuming and object detection are a notch below the Roborock’s, but its mopping is a notch above. The Narwal Freo X Ultra is an even better mop than the Dreame, but its obstacle detection isn’t great, and its vacuuming is merely pretty good.\nBest budget robot vacuum\nTapo RV30 Max Plus\nThe Good\n- Cheap, even with the auto-empty dock\n- A dual mop and dustbin means no swapping\n- Room-specific cleaning\n- Carpet boost\nThe Bad\n- Short battery life\n- Slow to recharge\n- Docking can be spotty\n- Basic obstacle detection\nDustbin capacity: 300ml / Self-empty dock option: Yes / Auto-refill mop option: No / Mop lift: No / Mop washing: No / Mapping: Yes, lidar / AI-powered obstacle detection: No / Suction power: 5,300Pa / Remote check-in: No / Keep-out zones: Yes, virtual / Brush style: Single rubber bristle hybrid / Works with: Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Siri Shortcuts\nFor around $300, the Tapo RV30 Max Plus is a very capable robot vacuum and mop with some key features usually only found on vacuums that are more than twice its price. These include room-specific cleaning, multiple suction and water levels, smart lidar-based navigation, and an auto-empty dock. With brands like Roomba and Roborock, you’re often paying double for the privilege of not having to empty the bot’s bin.\nThanks to lidar navigation, the RV30 did an excellent job of navigating my house, cleaning the perimeters of the rooms, and then using a mesh grid to clean inside the rooms. I did have to tidy up before it ran, though, as there’s no camera on board or AI-powered obstacle detection — so cables and socks will trip it up.\nIts 5,200Pa suction power is impressive on a bot at this price, and ably sucked up Cheerios and dry oatmeal on hard flooring. It left some of the finer dust and debris, as its single bristle / rubber brush isn’t super effective. It fared less well on carpet. However, in the app, I could set it to clean a room three times for each job, after which it had generally picked up all visible debris.\nMopping was better than average for a mop with no pressure or oscillation. It has a wide mop pad, and the bot has a big 300ml tank (which also incorporates a 300ml dustbin), so it applies enough water to do a good surface clean.\nAnother unique feature for a budget robot is the ability to set customized cleaning for each room, choosing from five suction levels and three water levels as well as the three rotations.\n5,200Pa suction power is impressive on a bot at this price\nThe Tapo app is very simple to use, with an easy-to-edit map that lets you add virtual walls and no-go zones, add furniture, and designate carpet areas. There’s no carpet sensing, so you need to tell it where carpets are if you don’t want it to mop them. You can even set the cleaning direction and build up to four maps — again, features usually only found on higher-end robots.\nIt’s also super easy to start a clean, and I really like that you can just tap on the map to send the robot to that spot. The biggest downside of the Tapo is its tiny battery, which is just 2,600mAh. That is half the size of most vacs, and it couldn’t clean my entire 800-square-foot downstairs without needing to go back and recharge. It also takes a while to charge and occasionally had trouble repositioning itself on its dock. You can get the RV30 without the auto-empty dock for around $80 less if you prefer an even simpler robot vacuum setup. This way, it will fit under a couch or bed, but you’ll have to manually empty its bin.\nBest mopping robot vacuum for hard floors\nNarwal Freo X Ultra\nThe Good\n- The best mopping robot\n- Also good at vacuuming\n- Very quiet\n- Big water tanks mean less refilling\nThe Bad\n- Middling laser-based obstacle avoidance\n- Wonky app\n- Huge charging dock\nDustbin capacity: 1L / Self-empty dock option: No / Auto-refill mop option: Yes / Mop lift: Yes, 12mm / Mop washing: Yes, hot air drying / Mapping: Yes, lidar / AI-powered obstacle detection: Yes / Suction power: 8,200Pa / Remote check-in: No / Keep-out zones: Yes, virtual / Brush style: Single, conical rubber bristle hybrid / Works with: Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Siri Shortcuts\nThe Narwal Freo X Ultra is one of the best mopping robots I’ve tested — and it’s a good vacuum, too. Its spinning triangular mop pads rotate at 180RPM with 12n of downward pressure. Combined with its ability to swing slightly to get closer to baseboards, the Narwal does a very good job on hard floors. Its dual four-liter water tanks will keep you going longer than most other mopping bots as well, the majority of which feature smaller tanks.\nThe Narwal has some innovative features, including dirt sense — which analyzes the dirt level in the water and prompts it to remop — and an ability to adapt the pressure of its mop based on the type of floor, applying more pressure to tile and less to hardwood. “Freo” refers to the bot’s ability to make cleaning “decisions,” including going back to clean dirty floors.\nIts charging dock is very big, though, giving off a real Wall-E vibe. But despite the size, there’s no spot for an auto-empty dustbin; instead, Narwal’s disposable onboard bin compresses the dust, and Narwal claims you won’t need to empty it for up to 60 days. It wasn’t close to full after two weeks of testing. A bonus here is that there’s no loud noise, as is the case with most auto-empty docks.\nIts charging dock is very big, giving off a real Wall-E vibe\nIn fact, the Freo X Ultra is one of the quietest bots I’ve tested. Even at full power, it was so quiet that I had to check that it was working. Its anti-tangle brush and 8,200Pa suction did a good job on most carpet, but its 12mm mop lifting isn’t good for plush carpets.\nNarwal’s obstacle detection is also only okay; there’s no camera, and it routinely eats cables. Its three lasers can identify objects as small as a sock and move around them, and it did pass my fake pet poop test.\nThe app is very hard to follow, making it tricky to access all of the bot’s features. Mapping was fast, but it didn’t recognize all my rooms on the first go. It did better the second time, although splitting up rooms and naming them in the app was painful. The lack of a camera also means its navigation is spotty, and sending it to clean specific rooms wasn’t always successful. But if you’ve got a lot of hard floors to keep clean, it will do an excellent job.\nBest robot vacuum / mop hybrid\nDreame X40 Ultra\nThe Good\n- Self-removing mop pads\n- Mop extension reaches under edges\n- Self-cleaning washboard\n- Dirt detection tech\nThe Bad\n- Middling AI obstacle detection\n- Single rubber roller brush\n- App can be flaky\nDustbin capacity: 300ml / Self-empty dock option: Yes / Auto-refill mop option: Yes / Mop-lift: Yes, 20mm / Mop washing: Hot water, hot air drying / Mapping: Yes, lidar / AI-powered obstacle detection: Yes / Suction power: 12,000Pa / Remote check-in: Yes / Keep-out zones: Yes, virtual / Brush style: Single, rubber / Works with: Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Siri Shortcuts\nThe Dreame X40 is the best robot vacuum / mop hybrid because it can drop its mop pads automatically, extend them, and swing them to get under your cabinets and consoles. I watched the X40 spread its mops wide apart and swing behind my TV console, allowing it to access the dust wedged a good inch under it. That’s impressive.\nThe X40 also features an extending side brush arm to reach corners — like the Roborock S8 MaxV Ultra — and its dual oscillating mop pads are more effective than Roborock’s thin microfiber pad. If you have a mix of carpeted rooms and hardwood floors with high-pile rugs, the Dreame is the best robot vacuum for you.\nIts signature feature is its ability to automatically remove and reattach its mop pads, depending on whether it’s vacuuming or mopping. This solves the problem of how to vacuum and mop without getting your rugs wet. The robot will do this procedure multiple times during cleaning to ensure carpets are vacuumed and floors are mopped. Genius.\nWhile it’s a superb mopper, its vacuuming prowess is slightly behind the Roborock S8 MaxV Ultra because, despite its 12,000Pa suction power, it still only has a single roller rubber brush. The Roborock’s dual rollers are simply better at getting dirt out of carpets and tackling pet hair.\nIf you have a mix of carpeted rooms and hardwood floors with high-pile rugs, the Dreame is the best robot vacuum for you\nRoborock’s app is also more stable and easier to use than Dreame’s, which often crashes and can take a while to load. While the Roborock S8 MaxV Ultra is my top pick overall, the Dreame X40 is a very good vacuum, and the two companies are neck and neck regarding innovative features.\nThe X40 can also clean its washboard, something the Roborock can’t. That area can get quite grungy, so it needs a cleaning every few weeks. The X40 has AI-powered smart dirt detection that uses its cameras to identify spills like milk or particularly dirty areas. When it spots something, it will slow down and do a more thorough cleaning. I also like Dreame’s option to vacuum first and then mop, which the Roborock doesn’t offer.\nThe X40 has AI-powered obstacle detection, although Roborock’s is just a bit better. However, both still get tripped up occasionally by pencils and other small items — something that never happens with the Roombas with this feature.\nBest midrange robot vacuum / mop\nEufy X10 Pro Omni\nThe Good\n- Good AI-powered obstacle detection\n- Effective mopping\n- Excellent value\n- Nice dock\nThe Bad\n- Single rubber / bristle brush\n- Lower suction power\n- No heated mop washing\n- Some navigation issues\nDustbin capacity: Unknown / Self-empty dock option: Yes / Auto-refill mop option: Yes / Mop lift: Yes, 12mm / Mop washing: Yes, hot air drying / Mapping: Yes, lidar / AI-powered obstacle detection: Yes / Suction power: 8,000Pa / Remote check-in: No / Keep-out zones: Yes, virtual / Brush style: Single rubber / bristle hybrid / Works with: Amazon Alexa, Google Home\nThe Eufy X10 Pro Omni combines the Eufy Clean X9 Pro mopping robot vacuum and the Eufy X8 Pro self-empty robot vacuum. It’s the first Eufy with a multifunction auto-empty / wash / fill dock, and unlike many bots in this price range, it comes with AI-powered obstacle detection.\nWith 8,000Pa suction and oscillating dual spinning brushes for mopping, the X10 has all the same functions as the top-of-the-line, all-in-one bots — but it’s not quite as good at any of them. Which is sort of the definition of “midrange.”\nThe X10 has all the same functions as the top-of-the-line, all-in-one bots — but it’s not quite as good at any of them\nThe Eufy performed excellently in my mopping tests, even eradicating dried stains with its 1kg of downward pressure. Thanks to an onboard water reservoir, it didn’t have to head home to fill up as frequently as some mopping bots do. It also has heated mop drying to help prevent the base from getting stinky — a first in this price range. (There’s no hot water washing.)\nAn edge-hugging mode makes the robot swing its behind into the baseboards to help mop edges. With its square-ish shape, it got into corners better than most of the round bots. But its 12mm mop pad lift over carpet wasn’t effective, resulting in its pads getting hung up in a few places.\nThe X10 has great object recognition, allowing it to suck up Cheerios and piles of oatmeal while deftly navigating fake dog turds and cables. However, its navigation sometimes got screwy; it would go into a corner and stay there for a while, trying to figure itself out.\nWhile its vacuuming is good, particularly on carpet and tile surfaces, the single rubber / bristle roller brush lets it down and is a good illustration of my point that it’s not all about suction power; it’s also about the brushes and how you use them. The Eufy’s brush is supposedly anti-tangle — a cutting tool inside the robot should shred the hair — but this wasn’t effective.\nThe Eufy Clean app is very easy to use, and the lidar-powered mapping was fast and accurate, dividing my rooms correctly on the first try. There are many customization options — including room-specific cleaning, zone cleaning, and customized cleaning — but the app is clear and well laid out.\nBest robot vacuum for pet hair\nRoomba Combo 10 Max\nThe Good\n- Excellent vacuuming\n- Superior AI obstacle detection\n- Smart scrub feature works well\n- Attractive dock that doubles as a table\nThe Bad\n- Small mop pad\n- Limited cleaning customization\n- Mapping can take a long time\n- Navigation can be buggy\nDustbin capacity: 250 ml / Self-empty dock option: Yes / Auto-refill mop option: Yes / Mop lift: Yes, up and over / Mop washing: Yes / Mapping: Yes, vSLAM / AI-powered obstacle detection: Yes / Suction power: N/A / Remote check-in: No / Keep-out zones: Yes, virtual / Brush style: Dual rubber / Works with: Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Siri Shortcuts, Apple Home via the Matter protocol.\nWhile Roombas may have fallen behind the competition in terms of features and innovation, there’s one area in which they reign supreme, and that’s cleaning prowess. Their dual rubber roller brushes rotate in opposite directions to effectively dig up dirt from carpets, and they are by far the best at tackling pet hair on all surfaces. They are also one of the most self-repairable robot vacuums you can buy, with spare parts for most of the bot’s bits readily available.\nThe newest model, the Combo 10 Max, is the best Roomba for pet hair as it ties for the highest suction power of the current Roomba line, plus it can clean its own mop. It also has top-notch AI-powered obstacle detection that is able to tell the difference between pet poop and a pile of popcorn (and vacuum up one while avoiding the other).\nWhile its mopping isn’t great — the pad is tiny, and there’s no swinging to get along baseboards — it does a decent job, and its retractable mopping system is handy if you have a lot of carpets. All of this makes the Combo 10 Max a great buy for pet parents who are in a daily battle with shedding and occasional muddy paw prints.\nThe Combo is the first Roomba with a multifunction dock that can refill its mopping tank and self-wash its mopping pad, meaning less hands-on time for you. (The j9 Combo Plus has the same suction power and can refill its mopping tank but can’t wash the mop pad.) The SmartScrub feature that tells the robot to wiggle its butt to scrub your floors works surprisingly well, but it’s really only effective on small areas, making it good to run in hallways and around pet bowls for an extra clean.\nThe Dirt Detect feature remembers the dirtiest rooms, actively seeking out spots my hairy Wirehaired Pointing Griffon hangs out\nThe Dirt Detect feature remembers the dirtiest rooms, and I found that meant it actively seeks out the spots my hairy Wirehaired Pointing Griffon hangs out. The 10 Max can also be set to mop only, which is a new option and is handy for deep cleans. But there’s no hot water washing or hot air drying of the mop as there is on similar Dreame and Roborock models, so you’ll want to throw the pad in the washing machine every now and then.\niRobot’s app is also a bit of a pain point. While I appreciate its simplicity, I miss the deeper cleaning customization options that most other high-end robot vacuum apps offer. And it’s recently started popping up ads for Roomba products when I navigate between screens — which is one of the features I did not want to see migrate over from the competition.\nWhile its mapping is very good, it can take a really long time (Roombas use vSLAM, not lidar), and it doesn’t seem to adapt to changes in my home as easily as other robots. (It also doesn’t lose my maps as often as other robots.) I’ve also noticed that the newer Roombas (j9 and 10 Max) suffer from the occasional navigation glitches, occasionally getting confused and needing to be rebooted.\nI really like Roomba’s dock design, which, while large enough to accommodate two rather small water tanks, is the most stylish of all the multifunction docks. Plus, because you access the water tanks from the front rather than the top (as on most other models), it can be used as a table. That’s a small quality-of-life upgrade I enjoy.\nOverall, it’s a good-looking robot that vacuums really well and is smart enough to get the job done with limited intervention. If you’re not interested in mopping at all, however, save some money and get the Roomba j9 Plus. It has similar cleaning prowess, a self-empty dock, and no messing with mopping.\nOther robot vacuums to consider\n- The 360 Vis Nav ($499.99\n$999.99), Dyson’s first robovac in the US in almost a decade, is a powerful beast and the best robot vacuum for carpets I’ve tested. But its navigation needs a lot of work. If you have a simple floor plan with a lot of carpets, it is worth considering, but the short battery life and lack of an auto-empty dock are major cons. Read more in this hands-on. - The Roomba j7 ($599.99) is a previous top pick that has great AI-powered obstacle detection, excellent navigation skills, and superior cleaning power. It can be a bit rough with furniture, but it is aggressive at getting your floors clean and is a great vacuum-only Roomba.\n- The Dreame X30 Ultra ($399.99\n$899.99) is the older version of my top pick for a vacuum / mop hybrid and is a great buy if you can get it on sale. It does most everything the X40 Ultra does, just with lower suction power (8,3000Pa) and no flexi-arm. - The Roborock Q8 Max Plus ($659.99) is the bigger brother to the Q5 Pro (my pick for pet hair in my budget robot vacuum guide), adding better obstacle detection (still no camera) and better mopping. However, it has a smaller bin to make way for a much bigger water reservoir for mopping (350ml). If you like the idea of the Q5 Pro but want better mopping, this is a good option, although it’s currently only available without an auto-empty dock at Walmart for $179.99 ($20 off).\n- The Shark Matrix Plus 2-in-1 ($299.99\n$699.99) was my previous runner-up pick for a midrange option that self-empties its bin, vacuums, and mops. It mops very well, but you have to manually fill and attach the mop reservoir and empty the bin.\nWhat I’m testing and what’s coming next\n- The Matic is a $1,095 robot vacuum that doesn’t require a cloud connection and utilizes cameras for navigation. It’s also the first robovac / mop I’ve seen that can suck up both wet and dry spills. It’s easily the smartest machine I’ve tested, one that can mimic human cleaning with impressive precision and excellent mapping and navigation abilities. It’s also easy to operate and maintain, and it’s proven to be remarkably reliable. We’ll be publishing our full review soon, so stay tuned. In the meantime, here’s some video of it in action.\n- DJI’s new Romo robot vacuum / mop comes in three configurations, with the flagship model being the transparent Romo P, which retails for €1,899 (around $2,200). Then there’s the Romo A, which is partially transparent and costs €1,599 (around $1,700), and the white Romo S, which is the most affordable at €1,299 (around $1,500). All three use wide-angle dual-transmitter solid-state lidar — the same tech found in DJI’s flagship drones — along with a pair of fish-eye vision sensors, which allow them to spot objects as thin as a playing card. All three models offer built-in sound suppression and hot air for drying mop pads, although the auto-empty base for the high-end Romo P also features a slot for dispensing a “floor deodorizer solution.” At the moment, all three robovacs are only available in Europe.\n- Roborock’s Saros 10 ($1,599.99) and 10R ($1,599.99) are upgrades to the S8 MaxV Ultra. Both can automatically remove their mop pads when not needed — a new option for Roborock — and feature an AdaptLift chassis to climb high room transitions. The 10R features 19,000Pa suction power, StarSight 2.0 navigation, and oscillating mops. The Saros 10 has 22,000Pa of suction power, lidar navigation, and the vibrating flat mopping pad of the S8 MaxV.\n- Roborock also recently released the Saros Z70 ($1,999.99,\n$2,599), which is the first mass-produced robovac to feature a robotic arm that can pick up objects like socks and tissues. The arm itself isn’t particularly reliable, but the Z70 still functions as an excellent robot vacuum with 22,000Pa suction power, support for Roborock’s StarSight navigation system, and an AdaptLift chassis. Read our review. - In March, iRobot announced a new Roomba lineup that starts at $299 and goes up to $999. All of the robovacs come with lidar navigation and mapping, 7,000Pa suction power, and four suction levels. The pricier 405 and 505 models are the first Roombas to feature dual spinning mopping pads, while the 505 also offers heated mop drying, which is something even the higher-end Combo 10 Max lacks.\n- In April, iRobot also introduced the Roomba Max 705 ($549.99\n$899.99), which comes with an auto-empty dock. The Matter-compatible robovac brings back iRobot’s dual rubber roller brushes, which, based on our previous testing, do an excellent job of picking up pet hair; the 705 also features AI-powered obstacle detection, lidar navigation, and 13,000Pa of suction — the most of any Roomba to date. - iRobot recently released the Roomba Max 705 Combo ($1,299.99), an upgraded version of the Roomba Max 705. The step-up model comes with a new self-deploying mop cover to protect carpets from getting wet, along with an extendable mop that cleans corners and wall edges for a more thorough clean.\n- The new Eufy Robot Vacuum Omni E28 ($749.99 with code WS24T2352111\n$1,399.99) is a self-emptying, self-refilling, and self-washing robot vacuum / mop hybrid. The vac comes with a deep cleaner integrated into the charging dock, which you can use to spray clean water on stains before sucking everything into a separate wastewater tank. It’s also powerful, boasting up to 20,000Pa of suction power, and offers AI-powered obstacle detection and Matter support. - The Dreame X50 Ultra ($1,049.99\n$1,699.99) adds a “motorized swing arm” that acts like a leg, allowing the robovac to climb a transition up to 6cm tall. Otherwise, it’s a lot like the X40 Ultra, only with higher suction power. - The Ecovacs Deebot X8 Pro Omni ($839.99\n$1,399.99) is the first Deebot with a roller mop. It features an extendable mop that can clean itself, boasts 18,000Pa of suction power, and comes with a redesigned auto-empty fill dock. - The Switchbot K10 Plus Pro Combo ($397.09 at checkout\n$417.99) is an upgrade to the compact K10 Plus, a previous pick for the best robot vacuum for small spaces. It has better obstacle detection and a bump up to 3,000Pa of suction power. Plus, its auto-empty dock incorporates a manual stick vacuum. - The Switchbot S20 robot vacuum / mop hybrid ($480 with code BXBX40\n$799.99), which looks like the Switchbot S20 Pro announced at CES, launched in early August. It features an extendable roller mop and side brush, as well as 15,000Pa of suction power, which is more than twice that of our previous pick for the best mopping vacuum (the last-gen S10). - SharkNinja’s PowerDetect NeverTouch Pro 2-in-1 robot vacuum / mop ($599.99\n$999.99) can lift itself over rugs by up to 20mm. Uniquely, its automatic empty /wash / dry cleaning station doesn’t require bags. - Roborock’s Qrevo Curv ($999.99 $\n1,599.99) can raise itself to clear thresholds up to 40mm. The svelte-looking bot gets its name from a curved FlexiArm Arc side brush, which helps prevent hair from tangling as much. - Narwal’s Freo Z Ultra ($949.99 with code FRZU\n$1,499.99) is an upgrade to my current pick for the best mopping bot. It features dual cameras and dual AI chips for seeing and identifying objects, which should help with obstacle detection and vacuuming methods. - The Eufy S1 Pro ($799.99 $\n1,499.99) has a long roller mop that self-cleans as it mops and features a square-ish design that allows it to get into corners more easily. A single rubber roller brush, 8,000Pa of suction, and 3D-powered obstacle detection tackle the vacuuming.\nRobot vacuum FAQ\nSuction power is measured in pascals (Pa), and while most vacuums offer between 5,000 and 8,000, we’re starting to see robots with 18,000 and even 22,000Pa. Higher suction power will do a better job getting the fine dust and debris off your floor, but it’s important that it’s paired with effective brushes. The real key to a clean floor with a robot vac is consistency. Run it daily if you can; it won’t keep up as well if it only runs once a week. If you want hands-free cleaning everywhere, you’ll want to budget for one per floor or be prepared to move it around. You can also buy extra charging bases, and most models can map multiple floors.\nYes, every Wi-Fi-connected robot vacuum worth its salt today works with Alexa or Google smart speakers for voice control. However, some are limited to stop, start, pause, and maybe suction level, whereas others can be told to go clean specific areas. Here’s how to set up a bot with Alexa voice control or Google Home voice control. A couple of manufacturers now also work with Siri Shortcuts, so you can use Apple’s Siri voice assistant to command your bot. Robot vacuums are now part of Matter, meaning more opportunities for smart home integration and native Siri voice control for robot vacuums.\nMatter is a new smart home standard that allows connected gadgets to work with any smart home platform, including Apple Home, Amazon Alexa, Google Home, and Samsung SmartThings. When connected to your smart home platform through Matter, you should be able to control basic robot actions including start / stop and changing cleaning modes, as well as get alerts directly in the app, meaning you won’t need to use the manufacturer’s app for these functions.Matter 1.4 added support for cleaning specific areas, so while you will still need the manufacturer app to set up a map, you will be able to use your smart home platform app and / or voice assistant to direct the robot to do things like clean the kitchen or clean downstairs. Samsung SmartThings and Amazon both support robot vacuums in Matter; Apple added it to iOS 18.4, and Google said support is coming soon.While Amazon Alexa and Google Home have supported robot vacuums for years via the cloud, Matter will bring this control locally. It will also bring support to Apple Home for the first time, allowing you to control them with Siri through HomePods and add them to scenes and automation.There are still relatively few robot vacuums that support Matter.

It’s a ‘moonshot’ research project Google announced today called Project Suncatcher.\nGoogle has a ‘moonshot’ plan for AI data centers in space\nIt’s trying to figure out how to turn constellations of solar-powered satellites into data centers.\nIt’s trying to figure out how to turn constellations of solar-powered satellites into data centers.\nIf it can ever get off the ground, the project would essentially create space-based data centers. Google hopes that by doing so, it can harness solar power around-the-clock. The dream is harnessing a near-unlimited source of clean energy that might allow the company to chase its AI ambitions without the concerns its data centers on Earth have raised when it comes to driving up power plant emissions and utility bills through soaring electricity demand.\n“In the future, space may be the best place to scale AI compute,” Travis Beals, a Google senior director for Paradigms of Intelligence, writes in a blog post today. The company also published a preprint paper, which has not undergone academic peer review, detailing its progress so far on this endeavor.\n“In the future, space may be the best place to scale AI compute.”\nThere are major hurdles Google would need to overcome to turn this plan into reality, which it explains in the blog and paper. Google envisions its Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) orbiting Earth on satellites outfitted with solar panels that could generate electricity almost continuously, making them eight times more productive than similar panels on Earth, according to Google.\nA major challenge will be to ensure that the satellites can communicate well with each other. Competing with data centers on land “requires links between satellites that support tens of terabits per second,” Google writes. Maneuvering constellations of satellites into tight formations can help them achieve that, perhaps flying satellites within “kilometers or less” of each other. That’s much closer than satellites operate today, and already space junk from collisions is a growing risk.\nOn top of that, Google has to ensure that its TPUs can withstand higher levels of radiation in space. It has tested its Trillium TPUs for radiation tolerance and says they “survive a total ionizing dose equivalent to a 5 year mission life without permanent failures.”\nIt would be pretty pricey to send those TPUs into space at the moment. But a cost analysis the company performed suggests that launching and running a data center in space could become “roughly comparable” to the energy costs of an equivalent data center on Earth on a per-kilowatt/year basis by the mid-2030s. Google says it’s planning a joint mission with the company Planet to launch a couple prototype satellites by 2027 in order to test its hardware in orbit.\nMost Popular\n- iOS 26.1 lets you tweak Liquid Glass, and it’s out now\n- Coca-Cola’s new AI holiday ad is a sloppy eyesore\n- Making KPop Demon Hunters sound magical meant finding the right harmonies\n- Apple TV’s new name now comes with a new sound\n- Google’s TV Streamer (4K) is down to its best price to date ahead of Black Friday", "summary": "(summarizer_error: 401 Client Error: Unauthorized for url: https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions)"}

There’s usually a great deal happening on a mid- or high-end TV from LG, Sony, Roku, Hisense, or Samsung — even if the biggest discounts remain reserved for Black Friday, Amazon Prime Day, and the lead-up to the Super Bowl.\nThe best deals on 4K TVs\nShopping for TVs is hard. That’s why we’ve made the process easier by providing the best deals on great TVs.\nShopping for TVs is hard. That’s why we’ve made the process easier by providing the best deals on great TVs.\nRight now, there are a number of discounted 4K TVs to choose from, spanning a wide variety of prices, sizes, and feature sets. Whether you want a secondary screen for the bedroom or a high-end OLED that’s built to provide the ultimate gaming or cinematic experience, we’ve picked out the best TV deals.\nFeatured Products\nThe best 4K TV deals for most people\nSamsung Q8F\nSamsung’s Q8F is available for around $597.99 ($152 off) at Amazon, Best Buy, and B&H Photo in its 55-inch configuration, which is a solid value for a QLED 4K TV. Its quantum dot LED panel boasts great contrast (especially in HDR content). The Q8F has a 120Hz panel and four HDMI 2.0 ports. This means you can play in 4K at up to 60Hz with a Nintendo Switch 2, Xbox Series S/X, or a PlayStation 5 Pro, or at a faster 120Hz refresh rate bumped down to 1440p resolution. Samsung is also including two free months of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate with purchase, which will allow you to stream games directly to your TV through the cloud, eliminating the need for a console.\nThe TV is powered by Samsung’s Q4 AI processor, which is used to upscale HD video to 4K when necessary, to optimize the picture in real-time, and make navigating its interface feel snappy. Samsung also touts the Q8F’s audio system, which adjusts the EQ and boost dialogue volume when needed. If you’ve cut the cord with cable, you can watch over 2,700 free channels of TV (over 400 of which are exclusive to Samsung TVs) in addition to streaming services. You can save $402 by jumping up to the 85-inch model, which is on sale for around $1,597.99 at Amazon, Best Buy, and B&H Photo.\nIf you’re looking for a 65-inch TV for watching sports, TV shows, movies, or playing video games, Hisense’s U65QF is a great choice, one you can currently purchase at Amazon and Best Buy for $587.99 ($412 off). The TV features a native 144Hz refresh rate and two HDMI 2.1 ports, both of which can take full advantage of the high-speed display. It also sports a pair of HDMI 2.0 ports — which can carry a 4K signal at up to 60Hz — and a port assortment that makes it a good choice for current-gen consoles, 4K Blu-ray players, and streaming devices. If you connect a gaming PC with an AMD graphics card, you can even take advantage of the TV’s support for AMD FreeSync Premium Pro, which reduces graphical glitches such as screen tearing.\nThe U65QF has an LED screen, which means it can’t match the black levels or per-pixel brightness control you’d get with an OLED display. However, its full array lighting panel offers 300 local dimming zones. The TV can control the brightness of each zone to reduce blooming, which is what happens when the area around a bright object (think a lit torch in a cave) looks unnaturally bright. Additionally, the TV has a maximum brightness of 1,000 nits, so the image it produces should look good even in a room with some light interference. The U65QF also supports Dolby Vision, HLG, and HDR10 Plus for better color reproduction, and it features a Hi-View AI chip that automatically processes the image on screen so that it appears sharper.\nAs for its operating system, Hisense’s U65QF runs on Amazon’s Fire OS and features Amazon Alexa built in. You can use the smart assistant to control the TV’s many functions, search for content, control compatible smart home accessories, and look up answers to various questions with your voice. If you want an even larger screen, you can also pick up a 75-inch model for $779.99 ($520 off) at Amazon and Best Buy.\nThe best budget-friendly 4K TV deals\nAmazon Fire TV 4-Series (2024)\nAmazon’s last-gen Fire TV 4-Series is an affordable option if you want to upgrade a smaller HDTV to a 4K model. The 50-inch model is currently on sale for an all-time low of $259.99 ($140 off) at Amazon. The TV features an LED panel with a 60Hz refresh rate and support for HDR10 / HLG, which is totally sufficient for casual TV viewing or watching movies and TV shows. It runs Fire OS, and comes with a remote that allows you to summon Amazon Alexa with the push of a button for a query or command. You can also step up to the 55-inch model for $339.99 ($120 off), its best price to date, if you like its modest feature set but want a slightly larger screen.\nHowever, we should note that Amazon recently released a new 4-Series TV with support for HDR10 Plus, Wi-Fi 6, and Alexa Plus. It also features sensors that’ll automatically turn the TV on when you enter the room, so you can start watching something more quickly.\nHisense QD7\nIf your budget is under $500, the 55-inch Hisense QD7 has a lot to offer, especially now that it’s on sale for an all-time low of $329.99 ($170 off) at Amazon and Best Buy. It features a QLED panel that can deliver more contrast and brightness than a typical LED TV, with support for HDR10 Plus and Dolby Vision, with a peak brightness of 600 nits. The 4K set features a processor capable of AI upscaling and full array local dimming with 160 local dimming zones. A panel with full array local dimming offers better control of brightness and contrast than direct- or edge-lit LED panels (this video from LG shows how it works), providing a more consistent picture across the entire screen. The QD7’s obvious weak point is gaming, due to its 60Hz refresh rate, but if that’s not important to you, it remains a superb value. If you want a larger TV, you can get a 65-inch model for $459.99 ($140 off) at Amazon, which is the lowest price we’ve seen on the larger configuration.\nThe best deals on high-end 4K TVs\nSony Bravia 8 II OLED\nIf you want a TV that produces reference-quality images, Sony’s Bravia 8 II (K65XR80M2) is the best choice. It was recently selected as the top TV in Valve Electronics’ 10th annual TV Shootout based on objective and subjective tests conducted by a panel of experts comparing each set to the image on a $43,000 reference monitor (Disclosure: Verge editor-in-chief Nilay Patel was one of the judges). The 55-inch model also recently received a substantial price cut, dropping it to a new low of $1,998 ($602 off) at Amazon and B&H Photo.\nSony’s premium set has a 120Hz refresh rate panel, with two HDMI 2.1 ports that support 4K at 120Hz, and two HDMI 2.0 ports that top out at 4K / 60Hz. It doesn’t support Nvidia’s G-Sync or AMD’s FreeSync Pro, so there aren’t any specific features on this TV that PC gamers can take advantage of. Sony calls the Bravia 8 II its brightest OLED screen yet, and testing conducted by Hometheaterreview found its maximum brightness was 1,880 nits when viewing HDR content. Its predecessor topped out at 1,300 nits HDR video, or roughly 44 percent dimmer.\nThe TV runs on Sony’s XR processor, which uses AI to adjust the color, contrast, and clarity of whatever you’re watching in real time to look better. The judges in the aforementioned TV Shootout chose Sony’s set as the best model for SDR (Standard Dynamic Range) processing, but third of four models compared for HDR (High Dynamic Range) processing. Any OLED TV can show true black, but judges agreed that the Bravia 8 II pulled ahead in grayscale and contrast when viewing SDR video.\nSony says its TV has modes calibrated for Netflix, Prime Video, and its own Sony Pictures Core streaming services, too. Sony Picture Core is a streaming service that’s available on select Bravia TVs and Sony gaming consoles, and allows you to stream or download 4K movies at far higher bitrates than competing services. The Bravia 8 II comes with 10 credits, which you can use to download movies for offline viewing, and two years of unlimited streaming for films in its catalogue.\nIf you want this TV in a larger size, Amazon, Best Buy, and B&H Photo are all currently offering the 65-inch model for around $2,298 ($1,202 off), which is the lowest price we’ve seen.\nLG C4 OLED\nThe last-gen LG C4 remains one of the best OLED TVs you can buy, and the 65-inch model is currently on sale for around $1,296.99 ($1,403 off) at Amazon, B&H Photo, and Best Buy. Like LG’s newer C5 OLED, it has a 120Hz panel with support for VRR, Nvidia G-Sync, and AMD FreeSync Premium (the option exists to enable a 144Hz mode if you dig in the TV’s options). Its embedded A9 AI Processor Gen7 offers higher-quality video upscaling and image optimization compared to the C3. The biggest difference between the C4 and C5 is their maximum brightness. The C4 tops out at an advertised 1,000 nits, while the C5 tops out at around 1,165 according to tests conducted by Tom’s Guide.\nAdditionally, the C4 features a three-channel audio system, which might sound impressive compared to other TVs, but still can’t compete with a soundbar. When you’re not watching videos or playing games, you can also enable the C4’s Gallery Mode to display art. Basically, the LG C4 offers many of the same features as the C5, but retails for nearly $400 less. You can also save on the 77-inch model, which is on sale for $1,896.99 ($1,600 off) at B&H Photo.\nLG C4\nSony A95L\nSony’s 55-inch A95L is a premium TV with features that should appeal to gamers and cinephiles alike, and you can get it for around $1,598 ($1,202 off) at B&H Photo and Best Buy. The TV has a 120Hz panel and two HDMI 2.1 ports (four HDMI ports total), so you can play games in 4K at up to 120 frames per second. Its two HDMI 2.0 ports are fine for last-gen consoles like the original Nintendo Switch. If you connect a PS5, the TV will adjust its video settings based on the genre of game you’re playing, which is a nice touch, but games on that console will look incredible on any OLED set.\nSony’s Cognitive Processor XR powers the A95L, which enables better motion processing so sports and games look less blurry. It also claims to improve the contrast and colors compared to previous generation Sony TVs. It has a peak brightness of 1,300 nits according to lab tests by Tom’s Guide, which is higher than most of the other OLED TVs we found on sale.\nThe A95L is a Bravia-series TV, which means it can access Sony’s Picture Core. This video on demand service has the highest-bitrate (aka video quality) of any streaming platform, which means what you watch will look closer to an uncompressed 4K Blu-ray than a 4K stream from Netflix. Its library is limited, but Sony includes 10 credits with A95L, so you can download movies to keep forever, and a 24-month subscription that lets you stream videos from the library.\nIf you want a higher-end OLED TV, Sony’s A95L is a great choice and has features you won’t find on non-Sony TVs. You can also get the 77-inch model on sale for around $3,798 ($1,202 off) at Amazon and B&H Photo.\nSamsung S90F\nIf you want an OLED, but don’t have a lot of space, Samsung’s 42-inch S90F is down to a new low of around $897.99 ($300 off) at Amazon, Best Buy, and B&H Photo. The TV features a 120Hz panel and four HDMI 2.1 ports, letting you play games in 4K at up to 120 frames per second. The ability to connect all your current-gen consoles and a gaming PC simultaneously without sacrificing resolution or speed is impressive for an OLED TV under $1,000. The TV can also access Samsung’s Gaming Hub, which allows you to play games available through Nvidia GeForce Go, Amazon Luna, and other cloud gaming services on your TV without any additional hardware — besides a controller, of course.\nThe S90F supports Samsung’s OLED HDR, and it has an NQ4 AI Gen3 processor that optimizes its picture quality and can upscale non-4K video. The TV also runs on Samsung’s Tizen operating system, which offers apps for every major streaming service, and features support for both Alexa and Samsung Bixby, so you can use either virtual assistant to control your various smart home gadgets. If you like the S90F’s features but want a larger TV, the 65-inch model is also on sale for an all-time low of around $1,497.99 ($1,002 off) at Amazon, Best Buy, and B&H Photo.\nUpdate, November 4th: Updated pricing / availability and added deals for Amazon’s Fire TV 4-Series (2024), Hisense’s QD7, and Samsung’s S90F.\nMost Popular\n- iOS 26.1 lets you tweak Liquid Glass, and it’s out now\n- Coca-Cola’s new AI holiday ad is a sloppy eyesore\n- Making KPop Demon Hunters sound magical meant finding the right harmonies\n- Apple TV’s new name now comes with a new sound\n- Google’s TV Streamer (4K) is down to its best price to date ahead of Black Friday", "summary": "(summarizer_error: 401 Client Error: Unauthorized for url: https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions)"}

The 'as-close-to-possible' truth of invention by individuals or teams meant identifying the work, educating myself, writing questions, and sending emails. And after that process, I set up a chat because it all gets down to talking to someone on the other side of the world, about something that happened 30 or 40 years ago.\nIf the invention involves a team, I try to interview more than one person, so I can cross-check the facts. Not to call anyone out, it’s just that, given time, we all forget the facts. And everyone adds their personal take. It’s because of that, for example, that I know the English musician Peter Gabriel really did visit Apple's research labs as they tested the Apple Sound Chip, and gave the team his personal approval to use the song 'Red Rain' for the Macintosh II launch. Wil Oxford, Steve Perlman, Mike Potel, Mark Lentczner and Steve Milne told me so.\nAs I was wrapping up Version 2.3 of Inventing the Future, I spoke with Steve M and Mark about the AIFF (Audio Interchange File Format) audio standard that they built around the same time as their VIP visit. They did so as professional programmers, amateur musicians and electronic music experts. Milne and Lentczner knew users needed a standard file format to make their work lives easier and to fend off confusion in the nascent MIDI marketplace. But it didn't exist. So Steve and Mark consulted with users and manufacturers in the Apple cafeteria after hours. This work is interesting on its own but it also underpinned other research. The AIFF, Apple Sound Chip, and MIDI Manager work scaffolded QuickTime and its extensible video formats and programs in 1991. Senior engineer Toby Farrand told me:\nAudio drove the development of QuickTime more than anything.\nSo who or what drove the development of AIFF?\nSteve and Mark referred me to the IFF (Interchange File Format (IFF) and the TIFF (Tag Image File Format) that were built before AIFF, in 1985 and 1986 respectively. These file formats were the benchmark for open media standards. My search pivoted, as it always does, to understand those inventions. I expected to be able to find the engineer or engineers names, track them down and interview them. It has worked around 100 times before.\nJerry Morrison created IFF while working at Electronic Arts and then went to Apple, where he liaised with the AIFF team. I could easily background his work.\nSo I turned my attention to TIFF, built initially as an image standard for desktop publishing. TIFF was able to store monochrome, grayscale, and color images, alongside metadata such as size, compression algorithms, and color space information. In many ways, it was a lot like AIFF so I was keen to know more. But I couldn't find a TIFF creator. No matter how I enquired, Aldus created TIFF.\nTo be clear, while a search for AIFF will offer up a company (Apple) not a person, I was able to find Milne and Lentczner in part because of their unique names and because Apple publicised the AIFF work and those publications are archived.\nAll I had was Aldus, an American company that created desktop publishing with the help of Apple and Adobe. In fact, Paul Brainerd, the cofounder of Aldus coined the term 'desktop publishing' to quickly explain the technicality of what they were doing to potential investors. But Aldus and their seminal product, PageMaker, are long gone, and there were no breadcrumbs for TIFF's creation.\nFinally, after a day-long trawl through MacWeek back issues, I found Steve Carlson. (below)\nThen I ran a similar length search through the Computer History Museum’s amazing Oral Histories transcriptions. Brainerd mentioned Carlson's name in an interview. (below)\nBut it was too brief an explanation so I kept looking. Then the trail went cold.\nAnd that was because, folks had misspelt his name when quoting him and then that was copied into magazines, and reviews and so forth. Brainerd's CHM interview transcript was wrong. But I didn’t know that.\nI just kept looking for Steve Carlson.\nI found other inventors because they had unique middle or last names or by random methods such as searching glider pilot licences in the Napa Valley after a tip from a former colleague that 'so and so' was a pilot in retirement. I had no tips, no links, nothing.\nWhy couldn’t I find Steve Carlson?\nAll the while, the answer was right under my nose. I had downloaded the final Aldus TIFF specifications document, hoping to find the author’s name. However, the name is seemingly written in white text on white paper - making it invisible. What?\nSee below where I have highlighted the region with a blue block over the text.\nFor a reason I can’t recall, I downloaded a plain text version and typed in Carlson to see if he was mentioned, but I must have paused at ‘Carls...' and the search functionality automatically filled in the rest. Suddenly I was staring at:\nAuthor/Editor/Arbitrator: Steve Carlsen.\n‘Carls-EN’\nA quick trip to Google patents, and a search for Steve Carlsen, Stephen Carlsen. Bingo! Stephen E. Carlsen’s patents at Aldus (and Adobe) in Issaquah, WA.\nI checked the geography, as most folks of a certain age do not stray far from the addresses filed in their patents, and typed Stephen’s correctly spelled surname into the online US White Pages for Washington State. There was ‘a’ Stephen Carlsen listed in a retirement village in WA. His age matched, but there were no public facing email addresses.\nI searched bulletin boards on the topic of TIFF, as I had found a former Apple engineer that way. Don had picked an abbreviation of his initials and numbers to post on BBS in his college days and then carried that same combination into adulthood. Many of us did. I took a punt pasting his unique prefix into hotmail, gmail etc. and found Don and interviewed him, but - Stephen Carlsen did not show up in a BBS. So, no email to try.\nMy ‘last straw' method for finding someone is a stamped envelope. I wrote, printed and mailed a one-page letter to Stephen's listed address, and crossed my fingers. Four months later he popped up in my email.\nIt was a surprise and a relief. We swapped a few emails, and he confirmed the TIFF catalyst story. For Stephen it was 'no big deal'. Once he had built the initial TIFF, Aldus needed to convince 3rd party developers and scanner manufacturers to agree to TIFF as a standard.\n“We had to define and promote an industry standard for storing and processing scanned images, so that we wouldn't have to write import filters for every model of every scanner that would soon be entering the budding desktop scanner market.\"\nStephen himself did much of the evangelizing as Paul Brainerd later pointed out:\n“(Steve) developed the standard, and then we went out and promoted it in a series of meetings with specific companies - as well as some workshops we ran in Seattle and the Bay Area during the Seybold shows and the MacWorld shows.”\nI sent Stephen a draft of what I had written and he sent a prompt reply saying - ‘Looks good’.\nI followed up asking him how he ended up at a tiny startup in Seattle called Aldus.\nAt that time, I was interviewing for a graphics position at Boeing Computer Services in Seattle, and noticed a small wanted ad that sounded really interesting, and seemed to be an excellent match for my background and interests. I interviewed with Paul and the 5-person mostly-ex-Atex engineering team, and I was hired.\nOut of curiosity I put Stephen's email address, now that I knew it, into a Duck Duck search and found him helping people online with TIFF queries long after Aldus had been acquired by Adobe. He also contributed to a Google Group called tiffcentral.\nHaving interviewed so many people across more than a decade, I’ve got pretty good at judging those who would like to talk or type, those who are verbose and those that are not. I knew Stephen had said what he was going to say. I added his pioneering work on TIFF to the AIFF story and moved on.\nTwo years had flown by when I received an email yesterday. His ex-wife Peggy found my paper letter and wrote to me. Stephen passed away earlier this year.\nThank you for your interest in and support of Stephen’s brilliant work creating TIFF. I’m not surprised Stephen didn’t finish corresponding with you, as he had begun to struggle with using his computer and phone. Some days were better than others for him, but he began to lose touch with people during those months you were reaching out to him. He was a humble man, and I guess never pushed to be recognized, although I believe those who worked with him knew the truth. His last week was in my home, where he was never left alone.\nPeggy finished the email with, ‘I called him Mr TIFF up to his last moment.'\nThe 10,000+ hours of book research disappeared in an instant. As sad as it was, I could see clearly that all of my work was worth it. Every single second. Because of this email.\nMr TIFF.\nLast night, as everyone in my house went to sleep, I took a deep breath and edited the Wikipedia page for TIFF, the Tag Image File Format.\nIt no longer reads ‘created by Aldus’, it reads ‘…created by Stephen Carlsen, an engineer at Aldus'", "summary": "(summarizer_error: 401 Client Error: Unauthorized for url: https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions)"}

Instead, I would need to inject a more complicated routine that detects whether it was a text window and substitute a new rectangle for the size. But, you cannot simply insert code, as it would move all subsequent code down, and the jumps (subroutine calls) that cross over that location would now jump to the wrong spots. So, I need to jump out of their code to my own (appended at the end of the code resource) and return.\nFor example, SimpleText's code to get the size of MBarHeight can easily be performed elsewhere.

The wave of infections grew to 10% of the entire Internet within 24 hours, causing astronomically expensive damage for the time. However, the pioneering Morris worm malware wasn’t made with malice, says an FBI retrospective on the “programming error.” It was designed to gauge the size of the Internet, resulting in a classic case of unintended consequences.\nMorris worm dissection\nKnown to be something of a prankster, Morris must have felt some foreboding about releasing his ‘innocent’ program into the wild. Evidence of this comes from his release method. “He released it by hacking into an MIT computer from his Cornell terminal in Ithaca, New York,” according to the FBI.\nThe Morris worm was written in C and targeted BSD UNIX systems, like VAX and Sun-3 machines. Specifically, the FBI writes, it “exploited a backdoor in the Internet’s electronic mail system and a bug in the ‘finger’ program that identified network users.” In contrast to computer viruses, the worm Morris had devised had no need of a host program, but could self-replicate and spread autonomously.\nThankfully, the Morris worm wasn’t written to cause damage to files. Due to those unintended consequences, though, it precipitated massive slowdowns, and messaging delays and system crashes were common symptoms. It became a computer news sensation in the worst possible way. Just to get rid of the worm in a timely fashion, some institutions ended up wiping complete systems and unplugging networks for as long as a week.\nAmong the Morris worm's casualties were prestigious institutions such as Berkeley, Harvard, Princeton, Stanford, Johns Hopkins, NASA, and the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.\nWhodunit?\nExperts worked hard to find a fix, and while they did so, the question of who was behind the worm came to the fore. Understandably, whoever created and unleashed this worm needed to feel some consequences, and thus, the FBI was brought in.\nApparently, Morris sought to anonymously explain and apologize for the worm, but an inadvertent slip of his initials by a friend landed Morris in it.\nGet Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.\nFBI interviews and computer file analysis would subsequently confirm Morris was the culprit. He was indicted under the rather freshly inked Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986. After a court appearance for his misdemeanors in 1989, Morris ended up not with jail time, but with a fine, probation, and 400 hours of community service to complete.\nComputer worms have been around longer than the World Wide Web\nBack in November 1988, the Internet bore little resemblance to what it is today. For example, the World Wide Web (WWW) wasn’t even a thing. Though the WWW would soon form the core experience for the first tide of surfers in the 90s.\nAt the time, the Internet’s backbone was the NSFNET, the recent successor to ARPANET. Its purpose was mostly to expand the prior backbone’s reach beyond military and defense institutions, and it more broadly embraced academia. While we are here, it is worth mentioning that NSFNET was decommissioned in 1995, and succeeded by the commercial Internet, which emerged in the 1990s off the back of private ISPs and commercial backbones.\nSo, when we talk about 10% of the Internet being paralyzed by the Morris Worm, contemporary estimates are that about 6,000 of the approximately 60,000 connected systems were infected and impacted. Moreover, when we highlighted the potentially massive costs of this first worm propagating, estimates range from $100,000 to millions of dollars.\nComputer worms have remained a scary phenomenon in recent times. For example, we reported on the first-generation AI worm, the Morris II generative AI worm, last year.\nFollow Tom's Hardware on Google News, or add us as a preferred source, to get our latest news, analysis, & reviews in your feeds.\nMark Tyson is a news editor at Tom's Hardware. He enjoys covering the full breadth of PC tech; from business and semiconductor design to products approaching the edge of reason.\n-\nsb5k I was working at DEC when the worm slithered its way across the Internet, as part of an engineering team. I also helped manage our Ultrix systems; our IT department knew VMS only.Reply\nI don't remember which CPU was in our systems, but the worm was not able to run on our systems, but I did find it dropped in them. -\nGaston404 I completely disagree with the tone of the article. Depicting this as an accident without consequences and limited effect is simply incorrect.Reply\nBack then as a part time job I managed some of the traffic routing through Washington DC. Mail relays were shutdown and backed up queues were spooked off to tape. By today’s standards the volume of traffic may seem trivial but when many of these links ran at 56kbps or less. It was a mess. The main way administrators communicated with each other was email. This also affected collaboration between University researchers and access to the NSF super computer centers.\nAt the time rumors maintained that Morris used exploits that he learned from his father who had a consulting agreement with the NSA. So if this is true there is a certain level of non-originality.\nOn one hand stronger persecution may have reduced follow on internet crime. On the other hand the fragility demonstrated by this crime, resulted in the creation of procedures to deal with outages. If anything the naive sense of trusted collaboration that pervaded the Internet started to fade. -\nderekullo In 9 years, Tiktok has infected over 90% of the internet!Reply\nMuch slower but also much more insidious! -\nDS426 Reply\nThe next big social media craze is probably just around the corner.

The feature, called Personas, involves two or more users, all wearing Vision Pros, chatting with one another in real time but as virtual replicas.\nNow out of beta, Personas are part of Apple's avatar system for the Vision Pro, creating replicas of yourself via a 3D photo scan.\nTaking a scan of myself isn't a new thing. Some five years ago, I tried telepresence with 3D-scanned avatars on Nreal AR glasses with a company called Spatial. I've gotten peeks at Meta's realistic codec avatars. I explored cartoon avatar telepresence with Microsoft in HoloLens. And I've even scanned myself into all sorts of bizarre AI deepfakes using OpenAI's Sora phone app.\nStill, no one is doing anything in VR or AR headsets or glasses as advanced as Apple's Vision Personas. And we haven't seen the beginning of how good things could get.\nTo learn more, I donned an M5 Vision Pro headset and jumped into a FaceTime for an exclusive chat with Apple's senior director of the Vision Products Group, Jeff Norris, and the senior director of product marketing, Steve Sinclair. The two showed up as Personas in my home office. We wandered in like ghosts when the meeting started, face to face, so to speak. After a few minutes, it felt like we were actually spending time together in person.\nApple doesn't discuss the future. But Norris and Sinclair did explain some of the very cool 3D tech that makes Personas seem so realistic. As we chatted, I imagined that similar scans could be done on places other than Vision Pro, like maybe your iPhone, which would be accessible to more people.\nReal telepresence is expensive magic\nIt's hard to find another person who has a Vision Pro, but when I have, the eerie sense of someone ghost-walking into my home is like wizardry. Apple's VisionOS has evolved to allow collaboration between Personas, flexing virtual spaces out for up to five people to see and share virtual objects and apps together. Multiple people in the same room wearing Vision headsets can collaborate with Personas that can beam in remotely, as well.\nI've dreamed of that Tony Stark-like, Star Wars-hologram telepresence idea for years now. It's basically here. It's just walled into very expensive hardware.\nSmart glasses haven't been able to handle the load of avatars like this yet, although AR glasses from Snap and others may be trying soon. My question for Apple is: What technology is making Personas happen, and could it ever appear anywhere else?\nSplatting scan technology uses machine learning\nIn our meeting, Norris explains that Persona technology uses Gaussian splatting to create those surprisingly convincing 3D facial scans. Gaussian splatting is the key tech to many 3D applications right now, often applied to scanning objects or large-scale environments. Meta's Hyperscape Capture app on Quest can scan whole rooms into 3D-walkable spaces in VR, for example. It knits a 3D image or landscape from a series of 2D images using AI.\nWhat makes Personas unique is the focus on scanning yourself instead of your environment. Using VisionOS 26, Norris showed me the key changes from the earlier Persona versions. The renders can now show greater detail at multiple angles and capture details like jewelry and eyelashes. Bodies and faces are scanned together, which makes the render feel more seamless.\n\"There's machine learning involved, but not many people really realize that it's a concert of networks that come together,\" says Norris. \"We counted them up, it's over a dozen, but we actually reduced the number when we moved to this new version of Personas.\"\nI mentioned the possibility of scanning rooms into Vision Pro down the road (apps like Scaniverse and Polycam already show off 3D scans in headsets). Norris says Apple is already applying Gaussian splatting to the spatial 3D conversions of photos, which now look weirdly immersive in headsets. So, what's next?\nIt doesn't take much to capture the photos needed. Could it be done on iPhones?\nEven though the Persona scan is done via Vision Pro's headset, which requires me to hold up the headset to turn my head and scan, it's not a process that requires me to use Vision Pro's sensors extensively.\n\"We only need a handful of images when we are enrolling your Persona,\" Norris tells me. \"That includes a few facial expressions to help our networks understand how your face moves when you're talking and smiling. And that's it.\"\nI wonder whether an iPhone could eventually scan a Persona, which I'd find a lot easier than using the Vision Pro. Norris doesn't answer that directly.\n\"It's interesting to imagine different ways of accomplishing that,\" he responds. \"But right now, we love that it's self-contained to the device and that all the processing happens on the device. None of these images have to go anywhere in order for that to happen.\"\nWhat could this mean for our future sense of virtual identity?\nThe single Persona I scan and bond to my Apple ID on Vision Pro feels like it's designed to act as a one-to-one mapping for my virtual self. It's the closest thing Apple has to a substitute for using a camera to broadcast my actual face, which can't be done since I'm wearing a headset.\nAI companies are already scanning and generating virtual versions of people in increasing numbers of deepfakes, both intentional and unintentional. OpenAI's Sora app is the most prominent example now, and uses a similar type of face-scanning tech on iPhones to generate a \"Cameo\" of myself I can lend out to others.\nI ask Norris where the line can be drawn going forward. He makes it clear that Apple wants to clearly and securely represent a person in real time, not as a reproduction.\n\"We have focused Personas on that authentic representation goal,\" he says. \"We're trying to grant what I think is a fundamental human wish, which is: 'I wish you were here.' That begins by trying to be faithful to how we appear, and how we're moving, and how we're emoting as we speak.\"\nCan I have more than one Persona, or more customization?\nRight now, Apple limits you to using one Persona scan at a time, which surprises me. I'd love a variety of Scott Stein avatars in different moods or simply with different clothes. While Apple doesn't explore identity transformation via scans, I do appreciate the options for realistic glasses, and I'd love to be able to add more accessories.\n\"People can reenroll or just put on a different shirt and enroll again,\" says Norris. \"I totally understand why that would be something we'd want. But we're focusing on just the one at a time right now.\"\nWould Personas ever extend outside Vision Pro?\nI'm already thinking about more options for Personas, not just for Apple's expensive headset, but for iPhones and other devices.\nWhat if they could be personal stand-ins on our FaceTime calls? I can already call my wife on FaceTime from Vision Pro, and she can see my 2D Persona there. She laughs at it because it feels somewhat supernatural. If Apple has already opened the doorway this much with Animoji on FaceTime, why not Personas too?\nNorris insists that Personas work better in the Vision headset, which I agree with. The renderings feel more convincing, somehow. When we place ourselves in environments that are already half-composed of virtual things, these 3D-scanned identities appear more natural. But physical distance and body expressions can also happen in space. Personas can leave their box and hover around as torsos, hands and faces.\n\"I can tell a joke and you're gonna get it because you're gonna see my body language, and see my facial expressions that you don't see on a two-dimensional screen,\" says Sinclair. \"Here, we're in the room together, and it feels like we really are here.\"\nAs his Persona stands next to my cluttered desk in that virtual form, I realize he's right.\nApple is already receiving feedback about this for business uses. \"We're hearing about it in healthcare as well,\" Norris says. \"Doctors who create procedures and want to train other people. They don't have to travel around the country. They can just get on a FaceTime call with their Personas.\"\nI still see a future where iPhones, iPads, laptops and headsets all collaborate together, something companies like Microsoft and Qualcomm have pointed to as a bridge between headsets and flat-screen devices. Samsung and Google are discussing those types of connecting points with Android XR, too. Apple has an ARKit on iPhones and iPads, so the possibilities already exist.\nNorris says that Personas outside of a headset would be missing something right now. \"To get the full appreciation of the experience, you kind of have to have both the sensing capabilities and the incredible display capabilities. They really have to kind of come together to create a magic moment like this.\"\nAs Apple moves toward an expected line of smart glasses in the future, and inevitably toward more advanced iPhones and iPads, that philosophy could evolve. Personas are the start of a fundamental change in how we handle collaboration and connection.\nFor the moment, however, you'll never experience it unless you're inside a Vision Pro. I look forward to a time when the entry ticket into this magic telepresence world is far more affordable and better distributed, so more people can come aboard.\nRight now, my Persona is mainly by itself. I'd love it if I could get some company more often.\nDon't miss any of our unbiased tech content and lab-based reviews.

With the pg_lake\nextensions, you can use Postgres as a stand-alone lakehouse system that supports transactions and fast queries on Iceberg tables, and can directly work with raw data files in object stores like S3.\nAt a high level, pg_lake\nlets you:\n- Create and modify Iceberg tables directly from PostgreSQL, with full transactional guarantees and query them from other engines\n- Query and import data from Parquet, CSV, JSON, and Iceberg files stored in S3 or other compatible object stores\n- Export query results back to S3 in Parquet, CSV, or JSON formats using COPY commands\n- Read geospatial formats supported by GDAL, such as GeoJSON and Shapefiles\n- Use compression transparently with .gz and .zst\n- Use the built-in map type for semi-structured or key–value data\n- Combine heap, Iceberg, and external Parquet/CSV/JSON files in the same SQL queries and modifications — all with full transactional guarantees and no SQL limitations\n- Infer table columns and types from external data sources such as Iceberg, Parquet, JSON, and CSV files\n- Leverage DuckDB’s query engine underneath for fast execution without leaving Postgres\nThere are two ways to set up pg_lake\n:\n- Using Docker, for an easy, ready-to-run test environment.\n- Building from source, for a manual setup or development use.\nBoth approaches include the PostgreSQL extensions, the pgduck_server\napplication and setting up S3-compatible storage.\nFollow the Docker README to set up and run pg_lake\nwith Docker.\nOnce you’ve built and installed the required components, you can initialize pg_lake\ninside Postgres.\nCreate all required extensions at once using CASCADE\n:\nCREATE EXTENSION pg_lake CASCADE;\nNOTICE: installing required extension \"pg_lake_table\"\nNOTICE: installing required extension \"pg_lake_engine\"\nNOTICE: installing required extension \"pg_extension_base\"\nNOTICE: installing required extension \"pg_lake_iceberg\"\nNOTICE: installing required extension \"pg_lake_copy\"\nCREATE EXTENSION\npgduck_server\nis a standalone process that implements the Postgres wire-protocol (locally), and underneath uses DuckDB\nto execute queries.\nWhen you run pgduck_server\nit starts listening to port 5332\non unix domain socket:\npgduck_server\nLOG pgduck_server is listening on unix_socket_directory: /tmp with port 5332, max_clients allowed 10000\nAs pgduck_server\nimplements Postgres wire protocol, you can access it via psql\non port 5332\nand host /tmp\nand run commands via DuckDB.\nFor example, you can get the DuckDB version:\npsql -p 5332 -h /tmp\nselect version() as duckdb_version;\nduckdb_version\n----------------\nv1.3.2 (1 row)\nYou can also provide some additional settings while starting the server, to see all:\npgduck_server --help\nThere are some important settings that should be adjusted, especially on production systems:\n--memory_limit\n: Optionally specify the maximum memory of pgduck_server similar to DuckDB's memory_limit, the default is 80 percent of the system memory--init_file_path <path>\n: Execute all statements in this file on start-up--cache_dir\n: Specify the directory to use to cache remote files (from S3)\npgduck_server\nrelies on the DuckDB secrets manager for credentials and it follows the credentials chain by default for AWS and GCP. Make sure your cloud credentials are configured properly — for example, by setting them in ~/.aws/credentials.\nOnce you set up the credential chain, you should set the pg_lake_iceberg.default_location_prefix\n. This is the location where Iceberg tables are stored:\nSET pg_lake_iceberg.default_location_prefix TO 's3://testbucketpglake';\nYou can also set the credentials on pgduck_server\nfor local development with minio\n.\nYou can create Iceberg tables by adding USING iceberg\nto your CREATE TABLE\nstatements.\nCREATE TABLE iceberg_test USING iceberg\nAS SELECT\ni as key, 'val_'|| i as val\nFROM\ngenerate_series(0,99)i;\nThen, query it:\nSELECT count(*) FROM iceberg_test;\ncount\n-------\n100\n(1 row)\nYou can then see the Iceberg metadata location:\nSELECT table_name, metadata_location FROM iceberg_tables;\ntable_name | metadata_location\n-------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\niceberg_test | s3://testbucketpglake/postgres/public/test/435029/metadata/00001-f0c6e20a-fd1c-4645-87c9-c0c64b92992b.metadata.json\nYou can import or export data directly using COPY\nin Parquet, CSV, or newline-delimited JSON formats.

This process runs DuckDB together with our duckdb_pglake extension, which adds PostgreSQL-compatible functions and behavior.\nUsers typically don’t need to be aware of pgduck_server\n; it operates transparently to improve performance. When appropriate, pg_lake\ndelegates scanning of the data and the computation to DuckDB’s highly parallel, column-oriented execution engine.\nThis separation also avoids the threading and memory-safety limitations that would arise from embedding DuckDB directly inside the Postgres process, which is designed around process isolation rather than multi-threaded execution. Moreover, it lets us interact with the query engine directly by connecting to it using standard Postgres clients.\nThe team behind pg_lake has a lot of experience building Postgres extensions (e.g. Citus, pg_cron, pg_documentdb). Over time, we’ve learned that large, monolithic PostgreSQL extensions are harder to evolve and maintain.\npg_lake\nfollows a modular design built around a set of interoperating components — mostly implemented as PostgreSQL extensions, others as supporting services or libraries.\nEach part focuses on a well-defined layer, such as table and metadata management, catalog and object store integration, query execution, or data format handling. This approach makes it easier to extend, test, and evolve the system, while keeping it familiar to anyone with a PostgreSQL background.\nThe current set of components are:\n- pg_lake_iceberg: a PostgreSQL extension that implements the Iceberg specification\n- pg_lake_table: a PostgreSQL extension that implements a foreign data wrapper to query files in object storage\n- pg_lake_copy: a PostgreSQL extension that implements COPY to/from your data lake\n- pg_lake_engine: a common module for different pg_lake extensions\n- pg_extension_base: A foundational building block for other extensions\n- pg_extension_updater: An extension for updating all extensions on start-up. See README.md.\n- pg_lake_benchmark: a PostgreSQL extension that performs various benchmarks on lake tables. See README.md.\n- pg_map: A generic map type generator\n- pgduck_server: a stand-alone server that loads DuckDB into the same server machine and exposes DuckDB via the PostgreSQL protocol\n- duckdb_pglake: a DuckDB extension that adds missing PostgreSQL functions to DuckDB\npg_lake\ndevelopment started in early 2024 at Crunchy Data with the goal of bringing Iceberg to PostgreSQL. The first few months were focused on building a robust integration of an external query engine (DuckDB). To get to market early, we made the query/import/export features available to Crunchy Bridge customers as Crunchy Bridge for Analytics.\nNext, we started building a comprehensive implementation of the Iceberg (v2) protocol with support for transactions and almost all PostgreSQL features. In November 2024, we relaunched Crunchy Bridge for Analytics as Crunchy Data Warehouse available on Crunchy Bridge and on-premises.\nIn June 2025, Crunchy Data was acquired by Snowflake. Following the acquisition, Snowflake decided to open source the project as pg_lake\nin November 2025. The initial version is 3.0 because of the two prior generations.

So it’s only when you have your code in your head that you really understand the problem.” — Paul Graham\nSoftware development only becomes engineering with understanding. Your ability to reason through your most challenging coding tasks is constrained by your mental model of how things work — in other words, how quickly and how well you onboard to any codebase for solving any problem. However most AI vibe coding tools are aimed at relieving you of that burden by reading → thinking → writing the code for you, increasing the separation from you and your code. This is fine for low value, commodity tasks, but absolutely unacceptable for the hard, sensitive, and high value work that defines real engineering.\nWe all need more AI that turns your brain ON, not OFF.\nToday we are announcing Windsurf Codemaps, which are first-of-its-kind AI-annotated structured maps of your code, powered by SWE-1.5 and Claude Sonnet 4.5. Building on our popular work from DeepWiki and Ask Devin, Codemaps is the next step in hyper-contextualized codebase understanding, grounded in precise code navigation.\nEvery engineering task — debugging, refactors, new features — starts with understanding. Great engineers aren’t just good at writing code; they’re good at reading it, building mental models that span files, layers, and systems.\nBut modern codebases are sprawling: hundreds of files, multiple services, dense abstractions. Based on own experience and deep conversations with our customers across the Fortune 500, even top engineers spend much of their deep-work time finding and remembering what matters.\nIt’s a huge tax on productivity:\nThis is the frontier that AI coding tools haven’t yet solved. Onboarding isn’t even a onetime cost, you pay it every time you switch context and codebases. The faster and better you understand your codebase, the faster and better you’ll be able to fix it yourself, or prompt agents to do it.\nUntil today, the standard approach by Copilot, Claude Code, Codex, and even Windsurf Cascade, was to have you ask questions of a generalist agent with access to your code in a typical chat experience. But those solutions don’t solve focused onboarding and strongly grounded navigation to onboard, debug, and better context engineer for your codebase.\nAt Cognition, we’ve been investing far more deeply in understanding:\nCodemaps is our next investment in tooling that makes engineers the best versions of themselves.\nWhen you first open Codemaps (click the new maps icon or Cmd+Shift+C in Windsurf) with a codebase opened in Windsurf, you can enter in a prompt for the task you are trying to do, or take one of the automatic suggestions. You can choose a Fast (SWE-1.5) or Smart (Sonnet 4.5) model to generate your Codemap. Every Codemap is a snapshot of your code and respects ZDR.\nBased on our demos to customers, you will experience Codemaps best on your own codebase and asking a question about how or where some functionality works. In our dogfooding, we find particular effectiveness tracing through client-server problems or a data pipeline or debugging auth/security issues:\nIf all you wanted was to quickly jump through grouped and nested parts of your code that related to your question, this is already an improvement compared to asking the same question in Cascade, where answers are not as densely linked to the exact lines of code.\nYou can also toggle over to a visually drawn Codemap, which performs the same functions when you click on individual nodes: they send you to the exact part of the codebase you clicked on.\nHowever, if you want a little more context, then you can hit “See more” in any section to expand our “trace guide” that gives a more descriptive explanation of what groups the discovered lines together.\nFinally, inside Cascade you can also reference a codemap for the agent with @{codemap}\n(all of it, or a particular subsection) in your prompt to provide more specific context and dramatically improve the performance of your agent for your task.\nWe feel that the popular usage of “vibe coding” has strayed far from the original intent, into a blanket endorsement of plowing through any and all AI generated code slop. If you look at the difference between the most productive vs the problematic AI-assisted coders, the productive ones can surf the vibes of code that they understand well, whereas people get into trouble when the code they generate and maintain starts to outstrip their ability to understand it.\nTo understand is to be accountable. As AI takes on more of the easy work, the hard problems left to humans are the ones that demand real comprehension: debugging complex systems, refactoring legacy code, making architecture decisions. In this new era, the engineer’s role shifts from authoring to accountability — you might not write every line, but you’re still responsible for what ships. That accountability depends on understanding what the AI produced, why it changed, and whether it’s safe. Codemaps closes that gap by giving both the human and the AI a shared picture of the system: how it’s structured, how data flows, where dependencies live. Codemaps is our latest Fast Agent, but as we discussed in the Semi-Async Valley of Death, our goal isn't just about speed, it is to help your human engineers stay in flow, stay on top of their code, and to move faster and more confidently on the hardest problems, never shipping slop that they don't understand.\nAugment engineers for high value work, relieve them of low value work. The other local minima that the coding agent industry has gotten stuck in is in the general messaging of replacing engineers for low value work and not having any solutions for the hardest tasks apart from “pls ultrathink high, no mistakes”, which only gives autonomy to the agent, at the expense of the engineer. The long history of human-machine collaboration teaches us that we can always do more with the synergy rather than humans-alone or AI-alone. Our view is that the AI product that engineers will love most is the one that makes them better at their job, not the one that tries to replace them with a sloppy facsimile of themselves.\nWith Codemaps, we are now exposing to humans some of the indexing and analysis we do inside of our coding agents. These artifacts are sharable today across teams for learning and discussion, but we have yet to benchmark how much better they can make our coding agents like Devin and Cascade in solving challenging tasks on their own. We also see opportunities for connecting and annotating codemaps, as well as defining an open .codemap\nprotocol that can be used by other code agents and custom tooling built by you. Complementing our Fast Context feature, this is an advancement in human-readable automatic context engineering.\nYou can try Codemaps on the latest versions of Windsurf, or DeepWiki!", "summary": "(summarizer_error: 401 Client Error: Unauthorized for url: https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions)"}

The US Department of Homeland Security wants to greatly expand biometric data collection for immigration applications, covering immigrants and even some US citizens tied to those cases.\nDHS, through its component agency US Citizenship and Immigration Services, on Monday proposed a sweeping expansion of the agency's collection of biometric data. While ostensibly about verifying identities and preventing fraud in immigration benefit applications, the proposed rule goes much further than simply ensuring applicants are who they claim to be.\nFirst off, the rule proposes expanding when DHS can collect biometric data from immigration benefit applicants, as \"submission of biometrics is currently only mandatory for certain benefit requests and enforcement actions.\" DHS wants to change that, including by requiring practically everyone an immigrant is associated with to submit their biometric data.\n\"DHS proposes in this rule that any applicant, petitioner, sponsor, supporter, derivative, dependent, beneficiary, or individual filing or associated with a benefit request or other request or collection of information, including U.S. citizens, U.S. nationals and lawful permanent residents, and without regard to age, must submit biometrics unless DHS otherwise exempts the requirement,\" the rule proposal said.\nDHS also wants to require the collection of biometric data from \"any alien apprehended, arrested or encountered by DHS.\"\nIt's not explicitly stated in the rule proposal why US citizens associated with immigrants who are applying for benefits would have to have their biometric data collected. DHS didn't answer questions to that end, though the rule stated that US citizens would also be required to submit biometric data \"when they submit a family-based visa petition.\"\nGive me your voice, your eye print, your DNA samples\nIn addition to expanded collection, the proposed rule also changes the definition of what DHS considers to be valid biometric data.\n\"Government agencies have grouped together identifying features and actions, such as fingerprints, photographs, and signatures under the broad term, biometrics,\" the proposal states. \"DHS proposes to define the term 'biometrics' to mean 'measurable biological (anatomical, physiological or molecular structure) or behavioral characteristics of an individual,'\" thus giving DHS broad leeway to begin collecting new types of biometric data as new technologies are developed.\nThe proposal mentions several new biometric technologies DHS wants the option to use, including ocular imagery, voice prints and DNA, all on the table per the new rule.\n\"The rule proposes to grant DHS express authority to require, request, or accept raw DNA or DNA test results,\" DHS said, including \"to prove or disprove … biological sex\" in situations where that can affect benefit eligibility.\nDHS wants to use all that data for identity enrollment, verification and management of the immigration lifecycle, national security and criminal history checks, \"the production of secure identity documents,\" to prove familial relationships, and to perform other administrative functions, the rule states.\n- Facial recognition works better in the lab than on the street, researchers show\n- EU biometric border system launch hits inevitable teething problems\n- Vietnam to collect biometrics - even DNA - for new ID cards\n- Altman's eyeball-scanning biometric blockchain orbs officially come to America\nAs we noted in our story last week about DHS' new rule expanding biometric data collection on entry into and exit from the US, biometric technology - especially the often-used facial recognition scan - is ripe for misuse and prone to errors.\nThis new proposed rule goes far beyond subjecting immigrants to algorithmic identification tech prone to misidentifying non-white individuals, however, and reaches a new level of surveillance, with DHS seeking to collect and keep DNA test results - including partial profiles - from immigrants and some US citizens to verify family ties or biological sex when relevant. It's not much more assuring that DHS also wants to collect new forms of biometric data like voice records, which are increasingly easy to spoof with AI.\nWhen we asked DHS questions about its biometric expansion proposal, it only sent us a statement identical to the one it sent last week when we inquired about the new entry/exit biometric requirements. The agency didn't respond when we asked for a statement pertaining to this latest proposed rule.\nDHS is taking comments on the proposal until January 2; so far the submissions are nearly entirely negative, with posters decrying the plan as government overreach, comparing the proposal to communist China, and calling it a violation of Constitutional guarantees against unreasonable search and seizure. ®", "summary": "(summarizer_error: 401 Client Error: Unauthorized for url: https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions)"}

Teams with Would be in status below are featured in this week's top 12 projection, a snapshot of what the selection committee's ranking will look like when it's released later Tuesday. For each Power 4 conference, we've listed teams as Last team in and First team out. These are the true bubble teams hovering around inclusion. Teams labeled Still in the mix haven't been eliminated but have work to do. A team that is Out will have to wait until next year.\nThe 12-member selection committee doesn't always agree with the Allstate Playoff Predictor, so the following categories are based on historical knowledge of the group's tendencies, plus what each team has done to date.\nThe conferences below are listed in order of the number of bids they're expected to receive, ranked from most to least. Check back Tuesday night after the rankings reveal show for an updated bubble watch that will reflect the selection committee's latest ranking.\nJump to a conference:\nACC | Big 12 | Big Ten\nSEC | Independent | Group of 5\nBracket\nSEC\nWould be in: Alabama, Georgia, Ole Miss, Texas A&M\nLast team in: Ole Miss. The Rebels are in a safe spot, but they're not a lock if they don't run the table. With remaining games against The Citadel, Florida and at rival Mississippi State, there's no possibility of a \"good loss\" remaining, and historically, losing in November has been far more damaging to playoff hopes than losing earlier in the season. Ole Miss shouldn't lose; it has at least a 72% chance of winning each of its remaining games and has the seventh-best chance in the country (43%) to win out. If an upset occurred, though, the Rebels would join the two-loss club and might not win a debate with other two-loss teams that had more statement wins -- and didn't lose to an unranked opponent. The Rebels' remaining schedule strength is No. 56 in the country. With a second loss, Ole Miss would be banking on wins against Oklahoma, Tulane and LSU to impress the committee enough for an at-large bid.\nFirst team out: Texas. The Longhorns got a significant boost this week in part because three teams above them fell out -- Vanderbilt, Georgia Tech and Miami -- but also because they earned another CFP top 25 win against the Commodores. The head-to-head win against Oklahoma also could help them with the committee. If Texas is ranked No. 11 or No. 12 by the committee, though -- and the ACC and Group of 5 champions are outside of the committee's top 12 -- the Longhorns would be elbowed out during the seeding process to make room for the fourth- and fifth-highest ranked conference champions, which are guaranteed spots in the playoff.\nStill in the mix: Missouri, Oklahoma, Vanderbilt. The Sooners earned a huge résumé boost with their win at Tennessee and have what should be a CFP top 25 win against Michigan. For two-loss Vandy, a close road loss to Texas isn't an eliminator. Where the committee ranks Tennessee after its third loss will impact both of their résumés as a common opponent. Missouri's only losses were to Alabama and Vanderbilt, but the Tigers don't have anything yet to compensate for those. That could change Saturday with a win against Texas A&M.\nOut: Arkansas, Auburn, Florida, Kentucky, LSU, Mississippi State, South Carolina, Tennessee\nBig Ten\nWould be in: Indiana, Ohio State, Oregon\nLast team in: Oregon. The one-loss Ducks have a more challenging second half of the season, and the committee is about to learn how good this team truly is. So far, Oregon's best win was Sept. 13 at Northwestern. The Ducks have been passing the eye test, but their opponents have a winning percentage of 47.2% -- ranked No. 116 in the country. The committee will still respect the double-overtime win at Penn State, but also recognize that the Nittany Lions weren't playing at an elite level even with James Franklin on the sideline. With road trips to Iowa and Washington -- both respectable two-loss teams -- and a Nov. 22 home game against USC, Oregon has a chance to further entrench itself in the top 12 but also a chance to tumble out.\nFirst team out: USC. The Trojans' two losses were on the road to respectable teams (Illinois and Notre Dame) by a combined 12 points. Their best win was Oct. 11 against Michigan, but the Trojans could really boost their résumé this month and completely flip the script with Oregon if they can win in Eugene on Nov. 22. According to ESPN Analytics, USC has the fourth-best chance in the Big Ten to reach the playoff (17.3%), just ahead of Michigan. The only game it's not favored to win is Nov. 22 at Oregon. If the Trojans can pull off that upset for a 10-2 finish, the committee would definitely consider them for an at-large spot.\nStill in the mix: Iowa, Michigan, Washington. These teams could be ranked by the committee Tuesday night, but Michigan will probably have the shortest climb into the conversation. The head-to-head loss to USC will be a problem in the Big Ten standings and in the CFP ranking, but if USC loses again and their records are no longer comparable, it can be overcome. Then, there's a head-to-head loss to Oklahoma. Still, Michigan has a 13.2% chance to reach the playoff, according to the Allstate Playoff Predictor. The Wolverines still have a chance to beat Ohio State and earn one of the best wins in the country en route to a 10-2 finish.\nOut: Illinois, Maryland, Michigan State, Minnesota, Nebraska, Northwestern, Penn State, Purdue, Rutgers, UCLA, Wisconsin\nBig 12\nWould be in: BYU, Texas Tech\nLast team in: Texas Tech. If Texas Tech loses to BYU on Saturday but still wins the Big 12, it's a CFP lock. The problem is that if the Red Raiders lose a second conference game, they will need some help to reach the Big 12 championship. So, a loss to BYU could be devastating to their conference and CFP hopes. If the Red Raiders beat BYU on Saturday, but lose to the Cougars in the Big 12 championship game, Texas Tech would still have a chance at an at-large bid as the Big 12 runner-up. The Red Raiders would be able to claim a win over the eventual Big 12 champs, which would be a much-needed boost to their résumé. It would depend in part on how the game unfolded. The Cougars are the Red Raiders' only remaining opponent with a winning record, as Texas Tech ends the season against UCF (4-4) and at West Virginia (3-6).\nFirst team out: Utah. The Utes are in a tricky spot because their two losses are to the Big 12's best teams -- BYU and Texas Tech. Utah still has the third-best chance to reach the Big 12 title game (22.8%), but it will need some help to get there. Utah's best wins are against Arizona State and Cincinnati, but the Utes have a hard time earning an at-large bid without beating at least one of the best teams in their league.\nStill in the mix: Cincinnati. The Bearcats are included here because they still have an 18% chance to reach the Big 12 title game, according to ESPN Analytics. They have only one league loss, which gives them some slim hope. Their other loss was in the season opener to Nebraska.\nOut: Arizona, Arizona State, Baylor, Colorado, Houston, Iowa State, Kansas, Kansas State, Oklahoma State, TCU, UCF, West Virginia\nACC\nWould be in: Virginia\nLast team in: Virginia. Like Georgia Tech, Virginia has a road loss to NC State as its lone blemish, but it was an early four-point loss, while the Yellow Jackets lost to the Wolfpack by double digits. Virginia also has a head-to-head win against Louisville. That's the Hoos' best win of the season, and likely their only one against a CFP top 25 opponent. That's why it's unlikely Virginia is ranked in the top 12 in the initial CFP top 25. Virginia would still be in, though, if it wins the ACC, even if it's ranked outside the committee's top 12 -- just like three-loss Clemson was last year.\nFirst team out: Louisville. The Cardinals lost at home in overtime to Virginia on Oct. 4 but earned a statement win Oct. 17 at Miami. Louisville will probably have only one win this season against a CFP top 25 team, which will make earning an at-large bid difficult. Louisville's best shot would be to run the table, have teams above it lose and win the ACC. Louisville has a 10.6% chance of winning the ACC, fourth best behind Georgia Tech, Miami and Virginia.\nStill in the mix: Georgia Tech, Miami. The odds of earning an at-large bid dropped significantly, but any team that has a chance to win its league will have a chance to lock up a playoff spot, and they're both in contention to play for the ACC title. Georgia Tech has the best chance to reach the ACC championship game (72.3%), followed by Virginia (51.1%) and Miami (28.5%), according to ESPN Analytics. Georgia Tech still has the highest chance to win out (40.5%) and win the league (41.2%).\nOut: Boston College, Cal, Clemson, Duke, Florida State, North Carolina, NC State, Pitt, SMU, Stanford, Syracuse, Virginia Tech, Wake Forest\nIndependent\nWould be in: Notre Dame. The playoff stars aligned for Notre Dame in Week 10, when Vanderbilt, Georgia Tech and Miami all lost, opening the door for the 6-2 Irish to move back into the top 10 after beating Boston College. The question is whether the selection committee will honor Miami's season-opening 27-24 win against Notre Dame because they have the same record. It's one of several tiebreakers, but not weighted, and if the committee deems the Irish the better team and not comparable now, Notre Dame can be ranked higher. Notre Dame has the best chance of any team in the country to run the table (68.3%), but the Nov. 15 trip to Pitt will be difficult. The Panthers, winners of five straight, are playing well and have a bye week to prepare for the Irish. The Irish's playoff position will remain tenuous until the clock runs out at Stanford with them 10-2.\nGroup of 5\nWould be in: Memphis. As the projected winner of the American this week, Memphis would earn a playoff spot as the committee's fifth-highest-ranked conference champion. The Tigers' Oct. 25 win against South Florida was critical in the league race, but the loss to 3-5 UAB is an ink stain on their résumé that can be overcome with a conference title. Memphis has at least a 57% chance to win each of its remaining games, according to ESPN Analytics.\nStill in the mix: USF, North Texas, James Madison, San Diego State. The committee would consider USF's head-to-head wins against Boise State and North Texas.\nBracket\nBased on our weekly projection, the seeding would be:\nFirst-round byes\nNo. 1 Ohio State (Big Ten champ)\nNo. 2 Indiana\nNo. 3 Alabama (SEC champ)\nNo. 4 Texas A&M\nFirst-round games\nOn campus, Dec. 19 and 20\nNo. 12 Memphis (American champ) at No. 5 Georgia\nNo. 11 Virginia (ACC champ) at No. 6 Ole Miss\nNo. 10 Notre Dame at No. 7 BYU (Big 12 champ)\nNo. 9 Texas Tech at No. 8 Oregon\nQuarterfinal games\nAt the Goodyear Cotton Bowl, Capital One Orange Bowl, Rose Bowl presented by Prudential and Allstate Sugar Bowl on Dec. 31 and Jan. 1.\nNo. 12 Memphis/No. 5 Georgia winner vs. No. 4 Texas A&M\nNo. 11 Virginia/No. 6 Ole Miss winner vs. No. 3 Alabama\nNo. 10 Notre Dame/No. 7 BYU winner vs. No. 2 Indiana\nNo. 9 Texas Tech/No. 8 Oregon winner vs. No. 1 Ohio State", "summary": "(summarizer_error: 401 Client Error: Unauthorized for url: https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions)"}

A third fell to a lower-ranked team. No. 5 Georgia flirted with disaster, as always, and just because nothing is allowed to make sense in the ACC, No. 15 Virginia and No. 16 Louisville also thought hard about face-planting before rallying.\nWeek 10 didn't give us quite as many absolute disasters as it could have, and the damage was mostly contained to the increasingly chaotic ACC. And with two-thirds of the 2025 college football season done, we now shift into Playoff Hyperdrive.\nLet's look back on Week 10, with help from the construct I used for the Week 10 preview: Playoff Tiers.\nUpdated playoff tiers\nThe first College Football Playoff rankings of the season come out Tuesday, and using a combination of the Allstate Playoff Predictor and odds driven by my SP+ rankings, we can pretty easily bunch teams into groups of playoff likelihood. The tiers didn't change much this weekend, though conveniently, each team that lost fell into the tier below.\nTier 1\nIndiana (9-0, 99.5% average playoff odds) -- def. Maryland 55-10 on Saturday\nOhio State (8-0, 99.3%) -- def. Penn State 38-14\nTexas A&M (8-0, 95.7%)\nWith A&M off and Indiana and Ohio State winning by a combined 93-24, nothing changed here. These are the three most likely teams to make the CFP, and though the playoff committee could overthink and try to talk itself into ranking Alabama ahead of A&M or something because of ranked wins, the Aggies deserve the edge because of their road win over Tier 3's Notre Dame and the extremely important fact that they didn't lose to a 4-4 Florida State team, as the Tide did.\nTier 2\nOle Miss (8-1, 83.6%) -- def. South Carolina 30-14\nOregon (7-1, 75.6%)\nAlabama (7-1, 74.0%)\nBYU (8-0, 69.3%)\nTexas Tech (8-1, 68.5%) -- def. Kansas State 43-20\nGeorgia (7-1, 54.1%) -- def. Florida 24-20\nWith Georgia Tech's loss to NC State on Saturday, the Yellow Jackets dropped from Tier 2 to Tier 3, but with a surprisingly comfortable road win over a smoking hot Kansas State, Texas Tech jumped from Tier 3 to 2. I'm curious how the CFP committee might view the Red Raiders, a team with eight wins by at least 23 points and a lone loss coming without starting quarterback Behren Morton. Their strength-of-schedule numbers aren't very good, but they ace the eye test, and if \"best\" is supposed to matter over \"most deserving,\" well, they're fourth in SP+.\nGeorgia, meanwhile, is uninterested in passing \"eye tests.\" The Bulldogs once again painted themselves into a corner, this time spotting rival Florida a 20-17 lead and letting the Gators drive into field goal range midway through the fourth quarter. But Georgia rallied once again, stuffing Jadan Baugh on fourth-and-1, immediately driving for a touchdown, then forcing a four-and-out and winning the game. The Bulldogs look impressive for about one quarter per game, but they're 7-1 with a Tier 2 win over Ole Miss and a lone loss to Tier 2 Bama. The road still features games against Texas and Georgia Tech, however.\nTier 3\nNotre Dame (6-2, 41.1%) -- def. Boston College 25-10\nVirginia (8-1, 37.6%) -- def. California 31-21\nLouisville (7-1, 37.1%) -- def. Virginia Tech 28-16\nTexas (7-2, 33.5%) -- def. Vanderbilt 34-31\nGeorgia Tech (8-1, 30.2%) -- lost to NC State 48-36\nTier 3 is evidently the transition tier. Of last week's four Tier 3 teams, one moved up with a win (Texas Tech) and two moved down with losses (Miami, Vanderbilt). Meanwhile, it caught Georgia Tech on the way down and Texas on the way up. And with all the other chaos in the ACC, two one-loss teams that won as favorites Saturday (Virginia and Louisville) saw their conference title odds rise by solid amounts. They also moved up from Tier 4.\nTier 4\nOklahoma (7-2, 27.0%) -- def. Tennessee 33-27\nVanderbilt (7-2, 26.8%) -- lost to Texas 34-31\nUtah (7-2, 24.2%) -- def. Cincinnati 45-14\nMiami (6-2, 17.9%) -- lost to SMU 26-20\nUSC (6-2, 14.0%) -- def. Nebraska 21-17\nWashington (6-2, 13.6%)\nMissouri (6-2, 10.7%)\nMichigan (7-2, 10.5%) -- def. Purdue 21-16\nPitt (7-2, 6.9%) -- def. Stanford 35-20\nDuke (5-3, 6.4%) -- def. Clemson 46-45\nIowa (6-2, 6.0%)\nSMU (6-3, 5.7%) -- def. Miami 26-20\nOklahoma and Vanderbilt have decent enough odds that I could have slipped them into Tier 3, but because they've both lost to Tier 3 Texas, and head-to-head matchups between two-loss SEC teams could matter a lot, we'll put them here. At this point, Tier 4 is a mix of two-loss Big Ten and SEC teams (OU, Vandy, USC, Washington, Mizzou, Michigan, Iowa), two-loss Big 12 and ACC teams that either have impressive wins (Miami) or are simply smoking hot (Utah, Pitt) and three-loss ACC teams that still have a puncher's chance at the conference title (Duke, SMU).\nTier (Group of) 5\nJames Madison (7-1, 27.7%) -- def. Texas State 52-20\nNorth Texas (8-1, 26.4%) -- def. Navy 31-17\nMemphis (8-1, 15.9%) -- def. Rice 38-14\nUSF (6-2, 13.9%)\nSan Diego State (7-1, 8.9%) -- def. Wyoming 24-7\nThere's still a scenario in which, say, SMU wins the ACC at 10-3 but ranks behind a pair of one-loss Group of 5 champions, and the G5 gets multiple bids. That said, one G5 bid is still far and away the most likely scenario, and that race remains awfully interesting. JMU impressed enough in San Marcos, Texas, last Tuesday that the Dukes jumped from 50th to 36th in SP+. They won't finish with a great résumé -- their most impressive performance was a loss to Louisville in which they were tied in the fourth quarter before a fumble recovery touchdown put them behind -- but they look the part enough that they should feel good about their chances if they finish 12-1 to win the Sun Belt, and the American Conference champ is 11-2.\nStill, it's clear the American winner, whoever it ends up being, is most likely to score the bid even if JMU's odds are better than any team.\nWhat Tuesday's rankings should look like\nFor the past couple of years, I've been fiddling with what amounts to a BCS-ish formula, derived half from the AP poll and half from a combination of both computer power ratings (SP+ and FPI) and computer résumé ratings (résumé SP+ and strength of record). With a few exceptions -- Alabama over Florida State in 2023, SMU over Alabama in 2024 -- it tends to adhere pretty closely to what the committee decides.\nTuesday's rankings will be the first since the CFP committee began using \"enhanced metrics to help evaluate schedule strength,\" however. What does that mean in practice? I have no idea. So, in anticipation of Tuesday's release, let's look at four rankings for the teams most likely to be ranked by the committee: (1) their AP poll ranking, (2) their ranking in this BCS-ish formula, (3) their strength of record ranking and (4) their résumé SP+ ranking.\nThis obviously adheres pretty closely to the tiers above, but it gives us a good idea of what to look for Tuesday night. If the committee really is taking strength of schedule or strength of record further into account -- and for the record, I really don't think it needed to -- then we might expect teams that are more well-regarded by the computers to win some arguments. Texas A&M would definitely rank ahead of Alabama in this case, and BYU might rank higher as well. Also, two-loss Texas and Vanderbilt would likely trump one-loss Louisville and Georgia Tech.\nAll in all, I think the top 11 on Tuesday should look almost identical to the AP poll, while the spots from No. 12 to No. 21 could be in pretty much any order.\nA hypothetical playoff simulation, because why not?\nBased on where teams are most likely to rank this week (via the BCS-ish rankings above) and which teams are most likely to win their conferences (per SP+), here's what I will call Week 11's playoff bracket.\n9 Texas Tech at 8 BYU\nWinner plays 1 Ohio State\n12 North Texas at 5 Georgia\nWinner plays 4 Alabama\n11 Louisville at 6 Oregon\nWinner plays 3 Texas A&M\n10 Notre Dame at 7 Ole Miss\nWinner plays 2 Indiana\nWe'll see a shakeup after Week 11's Texas Tech-BYU battle in Lubbock, but for now, this gives us Notre Dame's first-ever trip to Oxford, a potential playoff rematch between Indiana and Notre Dame in the quarterfinals and another Alabama-Georgia playoff game (this time, in the quarterfinals). Based on current SP+ rankings, it would also give us these national title odds based on 10,000 simulations:\nHypothetical title odds based on the above bracket:\n1-seed Ohio State 30.6%\n2-seed Indiana 28.2%\n6-seed Oregon 12.4%\n3-seed Texas A&M 7.4%\n4-seed Alabama 6.8%\n9-seed Texas Tech 5.6%\n5-seed Georgia 3.0%\n10-seed Notre Dame 2.4%\n7-seed Ole Miss 1.7%\n8-seed BYU 1.1%\n11-seed Louisville 0.4%\n12-seed North Texas 0.2%\nAnd because odds alone aren't very satisfying, I grabbed a random simulation from the batch of 10,000. Here's what's officially going to happen this postseason. You can stop watching now.\n(Please don't stop watching.)\nFIRST ROUND\nTexas Tech over BYU in Provo\nGeorgia over North Texas in Athens\nOregon over Louisville in Eugene\nNotre Dame over Ole Miss in Oxford\nQUARTERFINALS\nRose Bowl: Texas Tech over Ohio State\nSugar Bowl: Alabama over Georgia\nCotton Bowl: Texas A&M over Oregon\nOrange Bowl: Indiana over Notre Dame\nSEMIFINALS\nPeach Bowl: Alabama over Texas Tech\nFiesta Bowl: Indiana over Texas A&M\nFINALS\nIndiana over Alabama in Miami\nIf you Google Indiana's Curt Cignetti, as he told you to a couple of years ago, it might soon tell you that he's a national title-winning coach.\n5 other random thoughts from Week 10\nDamn, Mario. By Mario Cristobal's standards, his late-game management against SMU wasn't atrocious or anything, but after SMU tied the score with 25 seconds left, Miami got the ball back with a timeout in hand and a quarterback the school paid loads of money for ... and the Hurricanes kneeled out the clock to go to overtime. Granted, Carson Beck's dreadful overtime interception, which set up SMU's winning touchdown, certainly didn't help his cause, but it doesn't matter how much money you shell out if you're still going to play by \"Three things can happen when you pass, and two are bad\" rules in the 2020s.\nBut since Cristobal took over at Miami in 2022, his Hurricanes have lost five games as double-digit favorites; only Alabama can match that total, and (A) Bama has been a double-digit favorite 50% more often and (B) three of the Tide's five such losses came in a small cluster of games last season. Cristobal has lost at least one such game each year that he has been in charge. Death, taxes and Miami suffering a catastrophic loss it should have put away.\nHoly (whistle) smokes (whistle), Arkansas (whistle). Generally speaking, penalties and penalty yards don't correlate to wins and losses as much as you might think. Committing a lot of penalties can often signify that you're properly pushing the limits from an aggressiveness standpoint, and of the 66 teams to have suffered more than 100 penalty yards in a game this season, 38 won the game.\nIt's nice to know there are limits, however. Arkansas committed 18 penalties for 193 yards against Mississippi State on Saturday, the third most for any FBS team in any game over the past 10 seasons. Only Kansas (216 yards in a win over UNLV in 2023) and Northern Illinois (194 in a win over Eastern Illinois in 2017) can top that number. But though those teams still won, Arkansas' discipline ran out late. Mississippi State scored 17 points in the game's final 11 minutes to overcome a 14-point deficit and win 38-35. If Sam Pittman hadn't already been fired, he probably would be now. (And it probably goes without saying that interim coach Bobby Petrino hasn't shined enough to justify hiring him full time, though I'm sure you can still find an Arkansas booster advocating for it.)\nSo many close SEC games. We can question whether the SEC has a team the caliber of Ohio State or Indiana this season, but we cannot question its commitment to competitiveness. The league featured six games Saturday, five were decided by one score -- including both of its ranked-versus-ranked encounters -- and the sixth was within one score with 12 minutes left. For the season, the league has had 43 conference games to date, with 26 decided by one touchdown or fewer. It has been close enough overall that Arkansas somehow (A) ranks first in the league in points per drive in conference play and (B) is 0-5 in conference play.\nClose games will define the rest of November, too. Texas A&M (5-0 in SEC play) has two road games with a projected margin of less than two points, and despite being pretty close to the finish line, the Aggies have higher odds of losing two or more in November (27%) than reaching 12-0 (25%).\nAlabama (5-0) has three conference games remaining, and all three are projected within single digits, two within one score. SP+ gives the Tide only a 25% chance of winning its four remaining games, with 26% odds of losing at least twice.\nGeorgia's odds, meanwhile, are almost identical -- the Bulldogs (5-1) have two projected one-score SEC games remaining (at Mississippi State, Texas), plus a one-score visit to Georgia Tech. The result: a 25% chance of winning out and a 30% chance of losing at least twice.\nTexas (4-1) actually looked the part for most of Saturday's win over Vanderbilt, but the Longhorns are projected underdogs in two of three remaining games (at Georgia, Texas A&M), and Arkansas is not a gimme. Odds of winning out: 15%.\nOle Miss (5-1) has the most navigable path of any major conference contender, with only Florida and Mississippi State remaining in SEC play. Odds of winning out: 54%. Then again, the Rebels lost to Florida last year, and the Egg Bowl lives for nonsense.\nColorado looks done done. Over its past two games against Utah and Arizona, Colorado was projected to lose by a combined 23.1 points. The Buffaloes instead lost by 81. Last week's 53-7 loss to Utah was almost understandable in retrospect (the Utes just walloped Cincinnati, too), but they were equally moribund in Saturday evening's home loss to Arizona. And based on a weighted average of recent performances (where the most recent game carries more weight), they are officially the team that is underachieving the most against current SP+ projections.\nThere are plenty of other teams staggering and/or falling at the moment -- Syracuse, Penn State, Louisiana-Monroe, Delaware, Maryland, Texas State, Bowling Green -- but CU leads the pack. And if the Buffs can't beat West Virginia in Morgantown this coming weekend, a 3-9 finish begins to look awfully likely. Would that increase the odds of Deion Sanders stepping down at the end of the season?\nDeSean Jackson was a spectacular hire. Remember in the offseason, when Norfolk State (Michael Vick) and Delaware State (DeSean Jackson) went the Deion Sanders/Eddie George route and hired celebrated former players as their head coaches? Vick was the bigger headline-grabber -- he's Michael Vick, after all -- and he has struggled in Year 1, as you might expect from a first-time head coach. Norfolk State went 4-8 and finished 101st in FCS SP+ last season; the Spartans are just 1-8 and 115th this season. They have a couple of semi-winnable games left against Morgan State and Howard (they will likely get drubbed by N.C. Central this week), but it has been a year of growing pains.\nFor Jackson and his Hornets, however, it has been the opposite story. DSU went 1-11 and finished 123rd in SP+ last season, and it hasn't finished higher than 5-6 or 83rd over the past decade. Last Thursday's win over Vick's NSU, however, brought the team to 6-3 and 54th overall. The Hornets have already upset N.C. Central, and if they can win a toss-up game at home against S.C. State in Week 13, they'll win their first MEAC title since 2007 and score their first Celebration Bowl bid. It's looking like Jackson was one of the best hires of last offseason's coaching carousel.\nThis week in SP+\nThe SP+ rankings are updated for the week. Let's take a look at the teams that saw the biggest change in their overall ratings. (Note: We're looking at ratings, not rankings.)\nMoving up\nHere are the 10 teams that saw their ratings rise the most this week:\nFresno State: up 3.7 adjusted points per game (ranking rose from 93rd to 78th)\nEast Carolina: up 3.4 points (from 61st to 48th)\nFlorida State: up 3.3 points (from 34th to 24th)\nLouisiana Tech: up 3.3 points (from 76th to 67th)\nWestern Kentucky: up 3.1 points (from 88th to 72nd)\nBuffalo: up 2.9 points (from 99th to 87th)\nJames Madison: up 2.8 points (from 50th to 36th)\nArizona: up 2.8 points (from 43rd to 31st)\nUTSA: up 2.7 points (from 70th to 65th)\nNorth Carolina: up 2.5 points (from 98th to 89th)\nThe ACC's oddities didn't stop at the games involving ranked teams. Duke's win over Clemson was the most statistically unlikely result of the week -- Duke somehow won despite a mammoth efficiency disadvantage (success rate: Clemson 58.3%, Duke 37.5%) -- and in Tallahassee, Florida State somehow transferred all of its bad vibes to its opponent. Wake Forest collapsed under the weight of its mistakes and the Seminoles' sudden excellence, and the teams basically traded seven points: FSU moved up 3.3 and, as you'll see below, Wake moved down 3.7.\nMeanwhile, this is the faintest of praise, but since bottoming out at 103rd in SP+ three weeks ago, North Carolina has rallied to 89th, suffering a pair of gut-wrenching losses and finally getting off the schneid with a thumping of quarterback-less Syracuse. The Tar Heels will have to pull at least a pair of upsets to have any hope of bowling, but improvement can be encouraging in and of itself.\nMoving down\nHere are the 10 teams whose ratings fell the most:\nWake Forest: down 3.7 adjusted points per game (ranking fell from 56th to 68th)\nCincinnati: down 3.5 points (from 23rd to 32nd)\nMaryland: down 3.3 points (from 37th to 51st)\nGeorgia Tech: down 3.2 points (from 25th to 34th)\nBoise State: down 3.0 points (from 47th to 55th)\nColorado: down 3.0 points (from 68th to 82nd)\nUCF: down 2.9 points (from 51st to 56th)\nRutgers: down 2.5 points (from 63rd to 69th)\nSam Houston: down 2.4 points (no change from 135th)\nSouth Carolina: down 2.4 points (from 54th to 61st)\nGeorgia Tech entered Week 10 as the lowest-ranked unbeaten power-conference team by a comfortable margin. After getting pushed around by NC State, the Yellow Jackets are lodged between 4-5 Auburn and James Madison in SP+.\nWho won the Heisman this week?\nI am once again awarding the Heisman every week of the season and doling out weekly points, F1-style (in this case, 10 points for first place, 9 for second and so on). How will this Heisman race play out, and how different will the result be from the actual Heisman voting?\nHere is this week's Heisman top 10:\n1. Jeff Sims, Arizona State (13-for-24 passing for 177 yards, 1 TD and 1 INT, plus 228 non-sack rushing yards and 2 TDs against Iowa State).\n2. Julian Sayin, Ohio State (20-for-23 passing for 316 yards and 4 touchdowns against Penn State).\n3. CJ Bailey, NC State (24-for-32 passing for 340 yards and 2 touchdowns, plus 41 non-sack rushing yards and a TD against Georgia Tech).\n4. Jordan Marshall, Michigan (25 carries for 185 yards and 3 touchdowns, plus 25 receiving yards against Purdue).\n5. Owen McCown, UTSA (31-for-33 passing for 370 yards and 4 touchdowns against Tulane).\n6. Jeremiyah Love, Notre Dame (17 carries for 136 yards and 2 touchdowns, plus 30 receiving yards against Boston College).\n7. Arch Manning, Texas (25-for-33 passing for 328 yards and 3 touchdowns against Vanderbilt).\n8. Haynes King, Georgia Tech (25-for-35 passing for 408 yards, 2 TDs and 1 INT, plus 113 non-sack rushing yards and 2 TDs against NC State).\n9. Darian Mensah, Duke (27-for-41 passing for 361 yards and 4 touchdowns against Clemson).\n10. Melkart Abou Jaoude, North Carolina (6 tackles, 2.5 TFLs, 2 sacks and 1 forced fumble against Syracuse).\nJeff Sims is the journeyman prototype for the transfer portal era. He has started 28 career games at three schools (Georgia Tech, Nebraska and Arizona State), and in those, he has produced some duds -- 10 games with a QBR under 30.0, three under 10.0. But he has also thrown for more than 250 yards five times and rushed for 100 or more yards (not including sacks) seven times. And on Saturday in Ames, Iowa, he painted a Sims-ian masterpiece, throwing the ball reasonably well but ripping off an 88-yard touchdown run in the third quarter and nearly doubling his previous career high in rushing.\nSims is quite obviously not a Heisman contender, but one of the reasons I love this Heisman of the Week approach is that we can celebrate when guys like Sims do something beautiful. He even topped nearly perfect performances from Julian Sayin and Owen McCown and a gutsy, hobbled game from CJ Bailey.\nHonorable mention:\n• Luke Altmyer, Illinois (19-for-31 passing for 235 yards, 4 TDs and 1 INT, plus 95 non-sack rushing yards and a TD against Rutgers).\n• Alonza Barnett III, James Madison (12-for-18 passing for 264 yards, 4 TDs and 1 INT, plus 102 non-sack rushing yards and a TD against Texas State).\n• Tommy Castellanos, Florida State (12-for-16 passing for 271 yards and a touchdown, plus 18 non-sack rushing yards and a TD against Wake Forest).\n• Evan Dickens, Liberty (22 carries for 217 yards and 4 touchdowns against Delaware).\n• Caleb Hawkins, North Texas (33 carries for 197 yards and 4 touchdowns, plus 9 receiving yards against Navy).\n• Kevin Jennings, SMU (29-for-44 passing for 365 yards and a touchdown, plus a rushing touchdown against Miami).\n• Jayden Scott, NC State (24 carries for 196 yards and a touchdown, plus 11 receiving yards against Georgia Tech).\n• Danny Scudero, San Jose State (7 catches for 215 yards and 2 touchdowns against Hawai'i).\nThrough 10 weeks, here are your points leaders. I've bolded the guys who are also in the top 12 in the current Heisman betting odds.\n1. Ty Simpson, Alabama (29 points)\n2. Taylen Green, Arkansas (27)\n3T. Trinidad Chambliss, Ole Miss (25)\n3T. Julian Sayin, Ohio State (25)\n5. Demond Williams Jr., Washington (21)\n6T. Fernando Mendoza, Indiana (19)\n6T. Gunner Stockton, Georgia (19)\n8. Luke Altmyer, Illinois (16)\n9. Diego Pavia, Vanderbilt (14)\n10T. Haynes King, Georgia Tech (13)\n10T. Jeremiyah Love, Notre Dame (13)\nWe might be approaching a \"Winner takes the No. 1 seed, winning QB takes the Heisman\" game between Sayin's Ohio State -- the current Heisman betting favorite, per ESPN BET -- and Mendoza's Indiana in the Big Ten championship game in four weeks. Simpson, Chambliss and Stockton still have clear paths to impress, however, and with Love shifting into fifth gear over the past two games (a combined 41 carries for 364 yards) he might catch voters' eyes if he keeps ripping off 94-yard touchdown runs.\nMy 10 favorite games of the weekend\n1 and 2. SMU 26, No. 10 Miami 20 (OT) and Duke 46, Clemson 45. Obviously, Miami was the main character in Saturday's loss, but what a performance by SMU. Kevin Jennings nearly landed on the Heisman of the Week list with 365 yards, a TD pass and a TD run, and the Mustangs' defense, much improved of late, allowed just one gain of more than 25 yards, forced Miami to go the length of the field and pounced on mistakes. A great performance in a frustrating season.\nMeanwhile, because Manny Diaz is a soccer fan, I can confidently say he'll know what I mean when I say Duke pulled an absolute smash-and-grab in Death Valley, overcoming a massive efficiency disadvantage with a kick return score and not only a 5-for-5 performance on fourth down but 29 points scored after a fourth-down conversion. The Blue Devils remain in the ACC title race, and Clemson has only about a 39% chance of bowling, per SP+.\n3. Division II: No. 7 CSU-Pueblo 24, No. 6 Western Colorado 21. I love it when one of the Smaller-School Showcase games in my Friday preview lives up to its billing. Unbeaten WCU bolted to a 21-0 lead in the second quarter, but CSU-Pueblo had tied it by the end of the third quarter, with help from an 88-yard Roman Fuller-to-Marcellus Honeycutt Jr. touchdown pass. In the end, the Thunderwolves won with special teams: First, Jusiah Sampleton blocked a 47-yard field goal attempt with 4:01 left; then, after a 20-yard pass on third-and-16, Jackson Smith knocked in a 32-yarder as time expired.\n4. FCS: No. 25 Abilene Christian 31, No. 2 Tarleton State 28. Tarleton State was the best FCS team not named North Dakota State heading into the weekend, and after entering the fourth quarter down 28-10, the Texans rallied to tie it with 56 seconds left. But a 38-yard pass from Stone Earle to Bryan Henry set up Brandon Perez's 47-yard buzzer-beater. TSU is unbeaten no more.\n5. No. 5 Georgia 24, Florida 20. This game would rank higher if Georgia hadn't been involved, but the Bulldogs have pulled the football version of the \"Call the ambulance ... but not for me\" meme too many times, falling behind and then winning with perfect late execution. Regardless, it was a fun, tense way to spend an afternoon even if I didn't doubt the outcome.\n6 and 7. FCS: Idaho 35, Northern Arizona 32 (OT) (Friday) and Idaho State 38, No. 6 UC Davis 36. Drama in the Big Sky! On Friday night in Flagstaff, Arizona, Idaho watched a 26-7 lead turn into a 29-26 fourth-quarter deficit, but Owen Adams nailed a 42-yard field goal at the buzzer, and after forcing an overtime field goal, the Vandals walked it off with a short Hayden Kincheloe touchdown.\nOn Saturday in Davis, California, Idaho State, which has felt pretty close to an upset win all season, got one thanks to a 219-yard rushing performance from Dason Brooks and a 50-yard, final-minute field goal from Trajan Sinatra, the best-named kicker this side of Florida's Trey Smack.\nTrajan Sinatra makes 50-yard field goal\n8. Mississippi State 38, Arkansas 35. After heartbreaking losses to Texas and Florida extended MSU's SEC losing streak to 16 games (and more than two calendar years), it would take something special to end the streak. Like a game-ending 17-0 run, 193 penalty yards from Arkansas and a monstrous 18-yard catch and touchdown run from Anthony Evans III.\n9. New Mexico 40, UNLV 35. If you watched this one as I advised, you were rewarded. New Mexico played catch-and-release, losing leads of 21-0 and 34-21, but with the game on the line, the Lobos executed a perfect, eight-play, 75-yard touchdown drive, taking the lead on a 13-yard D.J. McKinney run, then making two late stops to move to 6-2 and secure bowl eligibility. It's hard to say enough about the job Jason Eck has done there in Year 1.\n10. Division II: West Texas A&M 53, Texas A&M-Kingsville 48. There should always be room for a nutty track meet on this list, and if you missed the first eight minutes of this one, you missed (1) a 74-yard return on the opening kickoff, (2) a 26-yard touchdown on the first offensive play, (3) a sack-and-strip fumble, (4) a 99-yard kick return, (5) two turnovers on downs and (6) a 43-yard touchdown pass. West Texas A&M took a 22-6 lead from all of that, Kingsville responded with a 22-3 run to charge ahead, and we got six more lead changes from there. Goodness.\n11. NAIA: No. 14 Indiana Wesleyan 56, Taylor 48.\n12. No. 20 Texas 34, No. 9 Vanderbilt 31.\n13. No. 18 Oklahoma 33, No. 14 Tennessee 27.\n14. Oregon State 10, Washington State 7.\n15. FCS: Central Connecticut 10, Long Island 7.\n16. NAIA: Cumberland 40, Cumberlands 37.\n17. Minnesota 23, Michigan State 20 (OT).\n19. Division II: Chowan 34, Erskine 30.\n20. Division III: Wesleyan 34, Williams 28 (OT).\nThe midweek playlist\nHere's your quick reminder that the CFP rankings are only the second-biggest landmark of the coming week. That's right: IT'S MIDWEEK MACTION TIME. And we start with a doozy.\nMiami (Ohio) at Ohio (Tuesday, 7 p.m., ESPN2). Miami has won five straight since an 0-3 start, and Ohio, the defending champ, has won four of five. The winner of this one will be your odds-on MAC favorite.\nUTSA at USF (Thursday, 7:30 p.m., ESPN). USF needs to win out to keep AAC title (and playoff) hopes alive, and UTSA is coming off by far its best performance of the season.", "summary": "(summarizer_error: 401 Client Error: Unauthorized for url: https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions)"}

The 2027 pick going to the Jets will be the better of the Cowboys' two first-round picks that year.\nEarlier Tuesday, the Cowboys acquired linebacker Logan Wilson from the Cincinnati Bengals for a 2026 seventh-round pick.\n\"It's exciting. Kudos to Jerry and Stephen (Jones) and Will (McClay) and I think being aggressive but smart because (it's) a couple of the moves we made you're getting guys not just for this year, but beyond, which I think is great,\" coach Brian Schottenheimer said. \"It gets you excited as a coach and I think it's two terrific players, but also terrific young men.\"\nThe Cowboys had discussions with the Jets regarding Williams in a potential trade for Micah Parsons before the season started, but they were told New York did not have the resources to sign Parsons to a mega-contract. Two months later, the Cowboys have Kenny Clark, who was acquired from the Green Bay Packers along with two first-round picks for Parsons, and Williams at defensive tackle, along with Osa Odighizuwa, who was signed to an $80 million contract in March.\nHours before the deal for Williams, the Jets traded star cornerback Sauce Gardner to the Indianapolis Colts for 2026 and 2027 first-round selections and receiver AD Mitchell.\nWilliams, 28, was the third overall pick in the 2019 draft and was selected to the Pro Bowl for the 2021-23 seasons, which included time with current Cowboys defensive line coach Aaron Whitecotton. For his career, he has 40 sacks, and this season has been credited with 32 tackles, a sack, 3 forced fumbles and 3 quarterback hurries.\nHe also leads all defensive linemen with a 9.5% run stop percentage this season, according to ESPN Research.\nAccording to ESPN Research, Williams' 40 sacks since entering the NFL in 2019 ranks fifth among primary defensive tackles over that time, behind Chris Jones (58.5), Aaron Donald (51.5), DeForest Buckner (50.5) and Cameron Heyward (45).\nHe is signed through 2027 and is set to make $20.75 million -- with $5 million guaranteed -- next year and $25.4 million in 2027. Clark is also signed through 2027 and is due an $11 million roster bonus if he is on the roster the third day of the 2026 league year with an $8.8 million salary.\nWilliams wasn't happy with the direction of the Jets, sources told ESPN's Rich Cimini. When news broke in February that Aaron Rodgers was going to be released, Williams tweeted: \"Another rebuild year for me I guess.\" He later apologized for the tweet, expressing faith in the new regime.\nHope quickly faded, as the Jets lost their first seven games. Williams told people close to him that he was frustrated by the losing. This is his seventh year, and he has yet to experience a winning season. He also wasn't happy with the way he was being used on defense. He recorded a sack on the first defensive play of the season (against Rodgers) and hasn't made one since.\nWilliams' contract also loomed as a potential issue in the offseason for the Jets, as they expected him to demand a renegotiation that would've meant more guaranteed money. Instead of investing more money in him, they decided to be proactive in offloading him.\nHow the Cowboys incorporate the three defensive tackles into Matt Eberflus' scheme will be of note. However, the Cowboys showed more of a five-man front vs. the Arizona Cardinals on Monday that shifted Odighizuwa's positioning some.\nRun defense has been an issue for the Cowboys for years, and the team hoped the addition of Clark would solidify it. While Clark has held up, the Cowboys have allowed more than 80 yards rushing in each game and at least 119 yards on the ground in six of them.\nAfter Monday's 27-17 loss to the Cardinals, team owner and general manager Jerry Jones spoke of making deals to help the 2025 defense as well as for the future. It is the most significant trade deadline move the Cowboys have made since 2018, when they gave up a first-round pick to the Raiders for wide receiver Amari Cooper.\nThe Cowboys ended up winning seven of their final nine games to win the division and made it to the divisional round of the playoffs, with Cooper invigorating a passing game that had been dormant.\nIn order to make the playoffs this year, the trades for Williams and Wilson must do the same, but the team still has issues with its pass defense.\nThe Cowboys are on their bye this week and return to action Nov. 17 against the Raiders. Players were scheduled to report to The Star on Tuesday but will be off for the remainder of the week.\nWilliams is expected to arrive Wednesday.\nThe first time Williams and Wilson will take part in a full practice will be next week.\nESPN's Rich Cimini contributed to this report.", "summary": "(summarizer_error: 401 Client Error: Unauthorized for url: https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions)"}

His skill and competitive nature will elevate everyone's play on the defensive unit. We're thrilled he's a Colt.\"\nThe deal gives a New York team that is 1-7 and in last place in the AFC East a chance to build toward the future. And the Jets weren't done, either, later sending three-time Pro Bowl defensive tackle Quinnen Williams to the Dallas Cowboys for a 2026 second-round pick, a 2027 first-round pick and defensive tackle Mazi Smith. New York now has three first-round picks in the 2027 NFL draft.\nGardner, meanwhile, gets a new start with a Colts team that holds the best record (7-2) in the AFC along with the New England Patriots and Denver Broncos.\n\"New York it's been real,\" he said in a message posted on social media.\nNew York it's been real💚\n— SAUCE GARDNER (@iamSauceGardner) November 4, 2025\nGardner was stunned by the trade, according to his brother and agent, Allante Gardner, who told ESPN's Rich Cimini that he received a call from a Jets front office official at about 12:15 p.m. -- about 30 minutes before the news broke. He said they had no inkling of a looming trade.\n\"I called Ahmad; he's in great spirits,\" Allante told ESPN, using his brother's given name. \"I told him this is a business decision, and he understands that. The Jets made a business decision. They couldn't turn it down, and Ahmad deserves to be on a winning football team.\"\nGardner missed Week 8 with a concussion, but first-year Jets coach Aaron Glenn said Monday that he was completing the protocol and was expected to return to practice this week. While no decision has been made about Gardner's availability, there is hope in Indianapolis that he can suit up for the team in Sunday's International Series game against the Atlanta Falcons in Berlin.\nGardner is expected to arrive in Indianapolis on Tuesday night with plans to practice Wednesday, according to a source.\nThe Colts are still without 2023 All-Pro cornerback Charvarius Ward, who is on injured reserve after multiple concussions but is expected to return soon. Ward was signed to a three-year contract in March for up to $60 million. The Colts also added safety Camryn Bynum at four years and $60 million this past offseason, dramatically making over their secondary.\nWith 2021 Pro Bowl selection Kenny Moore II still manning the slot and with the arrival of Gardner, the Colts could be deploying one of the best defensive backfields in the league.\nThe Jets' decision to deal Gardner came just months after the sides agreed to a record-setting, four-year, $120.4 million extension. That deal came just 24 hours after New York reached a long-term extension with wide receiver Garrett Wilson, seemingly locking up two franchise cornerstones long term.\nNow, half of that equation is gone.\nThe Colts will be responsible for paying only a prorated portion of Gardner's $1.25 million base salary in 2025, though their financial commitment increases beginning in 2026.\nIndianapolis had been among the more active teams in trade conversations in recent weeks. A source told ESPN that it approached multiple teams about trading for cornerbacks but were quickly rebuffed in each instance.\nBut Tuesday's move lands the team one of the best players to enter the league in recent years.\nGardner, the fourth pick in the 2022 draft, was the NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year in 2022, when he led the NFL with 20 passes defended that season. He is the only cornerback since the NFL-AFL merger in 1970 to be named first-team All-Pro in each of his first two seasons.\nLast season, he had a career-low seven pass breakups and a career-high four defensive pass interference penalties.\nMitchell, a 2024 second-round selection, has been playing sparingly since fumbling a would-be touchdown last month. The second-round pick in 2024 has just nine catches for 152 yards this year.", "summary": "(summarizer_error: 401 Client Error: Unauthorized for url: https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions)"}

His propensity to give up home runs -- he allowed 23 in 161 innings -- caused his ERA to balloon to 4.64.\nHis return to Detroit helps stabilize the Tigers' rotation in an offseason of potentially seismic change.

Detroit, which used 36 pitchers and three position players on the mound this season, finished 87-75.\nFollowing a wild card series win over Cleveland -- which overtook Detroit in the final month of the season to capture the AL Central crown -- the Tigers were ousted in the division series by Seattle.\nFlaherty's first go-around in Detroit in 2024 was a smashing success, with a 2.95 ERA and 133 strikeouts against 19 walks in 106.2 innings. He was traded at the deadline to the Los Angeles Dodgers, for whom he started five postseason games en route to a World Series title.\nHe returned in free agency to Detroit on a two-year, $35 million contract. The deal paid Flaherty $25 million this year and included a second year for $10 million. When he passed the 15-start mark this season, the salary doubled.\nThe comfort Flaherty found with manager A.J. Hinch and pitching coaches Chris Fetter and Robin Lund hastened his desire to return. While Flaherty's fastball velocity has always been average, the growth across the sport rendered his 92.8 mph average in the 26th percentile among pitchers. Nonetheless, Flaherty's superior off-speed pitches allowed him to strike out 188 with 59 walks.\nOver a nine-year career, Flaherty is 63-56 with a 3.80 ERA and 1,130 strikeouts against 351 walks in 990⅔ innings.", "summary": "(summarizer_error: 401 Client Error: Unauthorized for url: https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions)"}

Gannon said he still doesn't know if Murray will be placed on injured reserve because of it.\nSources told ESPN's Adam Schefter that Murray and the team have consulted with multiple foot doctors about the injury and have been told a possible timetable for his recovery could be anywhere from four to eight weeks because of an increased likelihood of a setback unless it heals properly.\nAn eight-week timetable would take Murray through the Cardinals' Week 13 contest at the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on Nov. 30.\nGannon said Tuesday that injuries \"never\" go how you think they will.\n\"He's doing well. He wants to be out there,\" Gannon said of Murray. \"He's a competitor. I talked to him today, but he's a good teammate and he's working to get healthy.\"\nThe stats seem to back Gannon's assertion that the Cardinals' offense is playing better behind Brissett:\n• In his three starts, Brissett is averaging 286 passing yards per game and 7.7 yards per attempt, and he has thrown for six touchdowns with one interception. In his five starts, Murray is averaging 170 passing yards and 6.0 yards per attempt, and he has thrown for six touchdowns with three interceptions. Each has run for one touchdown, despite Murray rushing 14 more times for 122 more yards.\n• Arizona's offense is averaging 25.7 offensive points and 357 yards per game under Brissett as compared with 18.8 points and 288.4 yards under Murray.\n• Arizona also is converting 56% of third downs in Brissett starts and 40% in Murray starts.\n• Brissett has thrown for 44 first downs in two fewer games than Murray's 50 first downs.\nBrissett, however, said Monday night that the reason the offense is playing well is because \"all 11 are doing a good job.\"\n\"We're doing the things that are needed to move the ball, stay on the field and score points,\" Gannon said. \"And that's been good to see because we've put up some numbers here now that you would say that you should have a chance to win the game when you put up over what the points we've been putting up.\n\"So, with saying that, this week's going to be a new challenge. In my opinion, the tape that I've watched so far, this is the best defense that we have faced, so it'll be a big time challenge, especially at their place.\"", "summary": "(summarizer_error: 401 Client Error: Unauthorized for url: https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions)"}

Brown was too important to the team to move him at the trade deadline, general manager Howie Roseman said Tuesday.\n\"I think that when you're trying to be a great team, it's hard to trade great players, and A.J. Brown is a great player,\" Roseman said of the team captain on a videoconference with reporters. \"He wears a 'C' for a reason. He's an important part of this team, of this organization. He cares about winning, he cares about his teammates, and I think when you're a team like ours that is looking forward to an opportunity to compete for a championship, you just don't get rid of guys like that.\"\nBrown, 28, is averaging a career-low 56.4 receiving yards per game this season and has expressed frustration over the state of the Eagles' offense on multiple occasions.\nHe posted a photo to Instagram following a breakout two-touchdown performance against the Minnesota Vikings in mid-October with a caption reading, \"Using me but not using me,\" prompting speculation about whether it was directed at the team. Coach Nick Sirianni said, however, that it was \"business as usual\" inside the Eagles' building.\nBrown eclipsed 1,000 receiving yards in each of his three seasons in Philadelphia and has been a part of two teams that reached the Super Bowl, including last year's squad that won it all.\n\"I feel very lucky to have him on our team and excited about the second half of the season with him,\" Roseman said.\nThe Eagles made a flurry of moves prior to the deadline in an attempt to increase their chances of a repeat. They acquired:\nEdge Jaelan Phillips from the Miami Dolphins for a 2026 third-round pick\nCB Jaire Alexander and a seventh-round pick in 2027 from the Baltimore Ravens for a 2026 sixth-round pick\nDB Michael Carter II and a 2027 seventh-round pick from the New York Jets for WR John Metchie III and a 2027 sixth-round pick.\nThe Eagles' edge rush group lacked production over the first half of the season but should look much different now with Nolan Smith (triceps) nearing a return, Brandon Graham unretiring and the trade for Phillips.\n\"He can rush, he can set the edge, he can play in space. He's got a nonstop motor,\" Roseman said of Phillips.\n\"Obviously it's got to come together on the field, but I feel like we've got a really good front, and obviously adding Jaelan to that puts a lot of pieces in place to give us the opportunity to be dominant up front.\"\nPhillips played for Eagles defensive coordinator Vic Fangio when Fangio held the same post in Miami in 2023 and was in the midst of a career year before tearing his Achilles.\nRoseman said the familiarity with all three players -- senior personnel director Joe Douglas was the Jets' general manager when New York drafted Carter, and passing game coordinator/defensive backs coach Christian Parker was with Alexander in Green Bay in 2019-20 when Parker served as a defensive quality control coach -- allowed for greater comfort making these in-season moves.\nAlthough Phillips' role seems easy to project -- he should be near the top of the edge rush rotation immediately -- it's yet to be seen how Carter and Alexander fit into a group that is led by Cooper DeJean and Quinyon Mitchell but has struggled to solidify the third player in the CB puzzle.\n\"I think the first half of the season showed us how important cornerback depth is,\" said Roseman, who saw corners Mitchell, Jakorian Bennett, Adoree' Jackson and Kelee Ringo all deal with various injuries. Roseman added that Carter can also play safety, another position that could use some bolstering.\nRoseman said, \"We're not done here,\" with respect to the roster back in August and made true on that statement. He also acquired running back Tank Bigsby, Bennett, QB Sam Howell, OT Fred Johnson and Metchie in recent weeks.\n\"If there's an incremental difference in a player, we owe it to our team, to our fans, to our building, to our owner to do that,\" he said.", "summary": "(summarizer_error: 401 Client Error: Unauthorized for url: https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions)"}

The teams may yet meet again in the spring, when Alexander-Arnold will be hoping to have more of a say.\nBradley's game to remember\nOne of the final moments of the match summed up the night. Alexander-Arnold, his every touch being booed, overhit his cross into the box and Bradley was there at the back post to shepherd the ball out of play, dumping Vinicius Junior on his backside.\nThe Anfield crowd enjoyed that, the homegrown replacement for the full-back who walked away from the Premier League champions to join Real Madrid, outshining him. It was tough night for Alexander-Arnold but for Bradley this was a game to remember.\nNot for the first time against Madrid. There was that tackle on Kylian Mbappe last season. This performance was probably more complete, shutting out Vinicius Junior time and time again. It was the sort of display to confirm his status as an elite full-back.\nThere were signs against Aston Villa, but this was another box ticked for Bradley. Slot has had to use Szoboszlai at right-back this season, but with the Northern Ireland international fit again he looks more than capable of cementing that place as his own.\nSlot's praise for Bradley\n\"Conor was outstanding, it was very nice,\" said Slot. \"Last season he was outstanding against Real Madrid, but he had to go off after 80 minutes. When he played 90 minutes against Villa, he again played 90 minutes with incredible intensity against Vinicius.\"\nHave Liverpool turned the corner? \"Let's be clear, we had a very bad run of form in terms of results, no excuse in the world can make up for us losing so many games. But we had to play a lot of games in a small amount of time, there was hardly any rest.\n\"Tonight we played against a team that played on Saturday as well, so both of us had two days' rest. It's helpful to play a home game, because from the last eight I think we played six away from home. The balance can give you just a bit of an edge.\"\nDid Trent coming on help Liverpool?\nAsked whether Alexander-Arnold's introduction helped Liverpool because the atmosphere became even more hostile for Madrid, Slot simply said that the atmosphere was good throughout the game. He revealed that he did speak to the player afterwards.\n\"I gave him a hug, I don't even exactly know what I said,\" responded the Liverpool head coach. \"Every time I will meet him, I will either give him a hug or talk to him, because he's been very special to me as a player and a human being.\"\nAlonso also shut down the suggestion that Alexander-Arnold coming on was a hindrance to his side. \"We needed his quality,\" said the Madrid coach. \"We needed his threat from the wing. It could be expected. Professional, mature, he was ready for that.\"", "summary": "(summarizer_error: 401 Client Error: Unauthorized for url: https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions)"}

'Sack the board' chants rung around the home end, as frustration with club owners Sport Republic boiled over.\nThey took over in 2022, sacked Ralph Hassenhuttl and have made a series of questionable appointments since. Nathan Jones was followed by Ruben Selles the season they were relegated.\nRussell Martin managed to return the club to the Premier League via the play-offs, but kicked off their abysmal 2024/25 campaign, with Ivan Juric the man who filled in between Martin and Still.\nIt is just two wins at home since the start of last season.\nWas Still unlucky with results?\nThe underlying data from this season would suggest so, yes.\nIn the Expected Goals (xG) table for this season, Southampton 'should' be fourth in the Championship table. No side is underperforming more.\nStill was clearly coaching performances that created chances, with the problem being that they simply weren't being taken.\nYou can see that both Southampton's main forward options, Adam Armstrong and Cameron Archer, were in the top six for xG underperformance after the first 13 gameweeks of the season.\nThe margins can be so fine in the Championship. And it seems Still's Saints just came out on the wrong side of the divide too many times.\nThere were, at times, chances missed that have to be seen to be truly believed. See Caspar Jander in the video below, spurning a golden opportunity in a game that eventually finished goalless last month.\nSouthampton were, quite comfortably, also the biggest xG underperformers in the league after 13 rounds of games.\nStill's side managed 13 goals, when the data suggests they should have notched 23.\nDespite all that, it felt inevitable that Still's time was up. And he cut a resigned figure after their latest defeat.\nStill in many ways dealt a bad hand\nSky Sports' EFL Editor Simeon Gholam:\nStill had longer to prepare for the start of this season than many, having been appointed way back at the end of May and even being in the stands for their final Premier League game of the season.\nBut business dealings were slow at Southampton, it can only have served to halve his pre-season preparations.\nIn attempting to squeeze maximum value out of departures. the likes of Tyler Dibling and Mateus Fernandes were not sold until the final week of the summer window, meaning arrivals were also delayed.\nTom Fellows and Finn Azaz were top Championship operators last season, but both have struggled to adapt after arriving in the final few days of August, with Jander and Leo Scienza in a similar boat.\nMix that in with a club low on confidence after such a miserable Premier League season, and a fanbase alienated from the ownership of the club, and it is no wonder that Still struggled badly. He was dealt a very bad hand.\nWhat comes next for Southampton?\nPerhaps if there was one more game scheduled before the international break, rather than two, he would have been afforded a final opportunity to turn things around. But instead, the owners decided to act ahead of their trip to QPR on Wednesday night, which is live on Sky Sports.\nQPR have lost three of their last four while the visitors to St Mary's on Saturday are Sheffield Wednesday. It presents Southampton with the chance to get their season motoring as they work out their next appointment.\nBut whoever takes charge - their fourth permanent manager since the start of last season - faces a huge battle to stop the rot.\nAnd his first task will be somehow getting his key attacking players to step up in front of goal and take their chances.", "summary": "(summarizer_error: 401 Client Error: Unauthorized for url: https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions)"}

Arsenal were sloppy in possession as the hosts dominated the opening 20 minutes, with Lukas Provod firing their best chance wide from a good area.\nBut Arsenal slowed down the momentum and stepped onto the game. Bukayo Saka was denied three times by goalkeeper Jakub Markovic - before he eventually got his chance - and it came via a corner.\nSaka's delivery aimed for Gabriel but struck Provod on the arm and VAR helped give a penalty by sending the referee to the monitor.

It's his versatility on the pitch, the things he can do. It's his mindset, his leadership and the way he is as a person.\n“Mikel hadn't played there [as a striker] in his career but we had a good experience of last season with the way he reacted and performed. We believe today, the way they were set up, it was a good chance for him to perform.\n“He always has good timing, and is capable of finishing the ball especially with one touch. And then it's about talking to him and making sure that he plays closer to the goal.\n“He identifies opportunities, the timing of it and the way he needs to attack the spaces in relation to how they defend.”\nAnalysis: Arsenal’s defence looks unbreakable right now\nSky Sports’ Sam Blitz in Prague:\nFirst, you have to get through the press. Arsenal’s front-footed play makes it impossible for opponents to play out from the back.\nThen you have to get through the low block. Arsenal are up there with the top Premier League teams for distance covered - as they move from that press into a low block that lets nothing through.\nIf you are lucky enough to get through, then there are key duel winners in William Saliba, Gabriel and Jurrien Timber to get past. Declan Rice plays in front of them too.\nAnd if you then get a shot - which six teams have only managed to do three times between them in the space of a month - then you still have to beat David Raya.\nLooking at that formula, it is no surprise Arsenal have managed eight clean sheets in a row.

This is shown by a large-scale study from Amsterdam UMC, with data from more than 4,000 transgender individuals, published in the European Heart Journal.\nThe researchers suspect that the hormone treatment transgender women receive has a protective effect on the heart and blood vessels.\nIn transgender people, the sex assigned at birth does not match their experienced gender identity. Many of them therefore choose hormone treatment to develop physical characteristics that better align with their gender identity, such as breast growth or a lower voice.\nFor transgender women, hormone treatment consists of the female hormone estradiol, often in combination with a testosterone blocker. For transgender men, it is the male hormone testosterone.\nIn transgender women, but also in women from the general population, estradiol appears to have a protective effect on the heart and blood vessels.\nMartin den Heijer, professor of endocrinology at Amsterdam UMC, says, \"Earlier studies suggested a higher risk of heart attack and stroke for transgender women compared to people with the same birth sex, that is, men from the general population. We did not really understand this.\n\"Now, however, we find no increased risk of heart and brain infarctions for transgender women who use estradiol. These findings fit well with what we know about the presumed protective effects of estradiol on the heart and blood vessels. With this research, we have solved a paradox that has occupied us for a long time.\"\nPrevious studies on cardiovascular disease in transgender people were often small-scale and limited to short periods, which could explain the earlier contradictory research results.\nThe researchers from Amsterdam UMC analyzed data from more than 4,000 transgender individuals and compared this with data from Statistics Netherlands (CBS), which collects health data from the entire Dutch population. This makes it the largest study in this field to date.\nFactors other than hormone use\nTransgender men who use testosterone do have an increased risk of heart attack and stroke, compared to women from the general Dutch population. That is in line with previous studies.\nMees van Zijverden, physician-researcher at Amsterdam UMC, says, \"We know that testosterone use in transgender men can lead to slightly higher blood pressure and poorer cholesterol levels, which increases the risk of cardiovascular disease.\"\nNevertheless, these changes do not seem to be sufficient to explain the increase in risk. The researchers think that factors other than hormone use probably also play a role in the increased risk of cardiovascular disease in transgender men.\n\"That is why we also looked at lifestyle and socio-economic factors in the study, such as education level, employment history and income. However, these factors were found to explain only a small part of the increased risk,\" says van Zijverden. More research is therefore needed into the exact causes of the increased risk in transgender men.\n\"If we have a better understanding of the factors that play a role, we can improve care for transgender people. The number of transgender people who use hormones is growing worldwide. This group is also getting older. This means that cardiovascular disease will become an increasingly important point of attention in the future,\" adds van Zijverden\nFor now, according to the researchers, it is important that transgender men and health care providers are aware of the increased risk of cardiovascular disease, so that attention is paid to maintaining a healthy lifestyle.\nIt is also important that risk factors, such as high blood pressure or cholesterol, are monitored in transgender men. Of course, this remains important for transgender women as well.\nMore information: Lieve Mees van Zijverden et al, Transgender persons receiving gender-affirming hormone therapy: risk of acute cardiovascular events in a Dutch cohort study, European Heart Journal (2025).

For this book, he partnered with Gaurav Suri, who earned his doctorate in psychology from Stanford and is now an associate professor of psychology at San Francisco State University, to explain what we now know about how the mind works in humans and in machines.\nWe spoke with McClelland about how neural networks have changed the concept of the mind, how that knowledge impacted the development of AI, and, in turn, how AI influences what we know about ourselves.\nThis Q&A has been edited for clarity and length.\nWhy did you decide to write a book about how intelligence arises in humans and AI?\nMy co-author and I have the shared conviction that most people think about their mind as a special kind of entity that exists in a conceptual or experiential realm—and that maybe even comes from some sort of divine stuff. Research in the psychological and brain sciences, however, supports a different view—one we wanted to share with a wide audience.\nThe key idea is this: Whenever we have a perceptual experience, react to a situation, or feel a certain way about something we observe, that is all coming from processes taking place within the very rich system of interacting neurons in our brains. In the book, we describe models that we and others have developed that illustrate how this happens.\nWe called the book \"The Emergent Mind\" because we wanted to capture the idea that the mind does not exist as a unitary thing but arises from the interactions of very simple parts, none of which are themselves intelligent.\nHow have neural networks, like the models you've developed, deepened our understanding of how the mind works?\nThe models show how the experiences that we have—the thoughts, perceptions, and the decisions we make and actions we take—can be the product of the confluence of multiple factors, carried by signals from different neurons, that are operating behind the scenes. These are not accessible to our conscious mind, but they give rise not just to our behavior, but also to our experience itself.\nAlso, we've illustrated how the interactions among the neurons can be heavily shaped by our experience. Since we don't perceive how our neural activity has been shaped, we tend to think that our experience arises from direct interaction with the real world as opposed to the effects of all these influences that arise from our past experiences and how they shape our reactions and perceptions.\nAdopting a neural network framework for understanding the mind will ultimately lead us to be better able to think reflectively about what we think we know; how we judge others and our own views; and how we should live with each other and with our AI technologies because in some ways, they are very much like us.\nWhat do you make of the recent advances in AI? Do you see them as approaching the level of human intelligence?\nIn the book, we explain how many of the successes of AI have been achieved because they rely on neural networks very much like the ones we use to model our human minds. But one of the important things that we talk about is how we're not the same as our artificial systems. In our view, we are still smarter than our machines in many ways.\nI take the view that by pursuing the effort to understand the human biological mind—as we're doing in the field of neuroscience and interdisciplinary research on the brain basis of cognition—we will ultimately have a deeper understanding not only of ourselves, but also of how to build better machines.\nSo just as the original AI ideas have been supplanted by our better understanding of neural networks, we may learn more about how to build better AI systems and how to better understand ourselves.", "summary": "(summarizer_error: 401 Client Error: Unauthorized for url: https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions)"}

But while dementia is widely recognized as a life-limiting condition among elderly people, few studies have assessed survival times and the factors associated with prognosis in those with early onset disease, explain the researchers.\nTo explore this further and help inform the treatment and care provision of those diagnosed with early onset dementia, the researchers reviewed and reassessed all 12,490 visits made to dementia outpatient clinics in two university hospital districts in Finland between 2010 and 2021.\nSome 794 confirmed cases of early onset dementia were identified, to include Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal dementia, alpha-synucleinopathies (in particular, Lewy body dementia), and \"other\" and \"mixed\" dementia, which included vascular cognitive impairment.\nThe survival times of each of these cases were compared with those of 10 people without neurodegenerative disease, but matched for age, sex, and geographical region, from general population data registers (7,930 people in total).\nDuring the study period, 215 people with early onset dementia died. Their average survival time was nearly nine years, but varied according to disease subtype.\nThe shortest survival time of nearly seven years was seen among those with frontotemporal dementia or Lewy body dementia (seven years), although those with both frontotemporal dementia and motor neuron disease (ALS) lived for just over two years, on average.\nThose with Alzheimer's disease lived for nearly 10 years, on average, while those with vascular cognitive impairment lived the longest—over 10 years, on average.\nCompared with those without neurodegenerative disease, the death rate from any cause among those with early onset dementia was more than 6.5 times higher. But when categorized by disease subtype, it was nearly 14 times as high in those with frontotemporal dementia, and more than 4 times as high among those with vascular cognitive impairment, for example.\nMale sex, older age, several co-existing conditions, and lower educational attainment were all universally associated with an increased risk of death, but they weren't specific to early onset dementia. It was the diagnosis of early onset dementia itself that was most strongly and independently associated with survival time, say the researchers.\nOnly diabetes, which is a known risk factor for dementia, was associated with shorter survival time among those with early onset dementia.\n\"Overall, although the survival time in years appears shorter in older patients, the impact of dementia diagnosis on all-cause mortality is more significant in the [early onset dementia] age group than in the late onset patients when compared with the general population,\" comment the researchers.\nThis is an observational study, and no definitive conclusions can be drawn about cause and effect. The researchers also acknowledge various limitations to their findings, including that most of the study participants had no genetic or neuropathological confirmation of their dementia. And the numbers in each clinical subgroup were small.\n\"Our study provides up-to-date [early onset dementia] survival rates in a validated population-based [early onset dementia] cohort, and highlights the substantial effect caused by [its] diagnosis on patients' mortality,\" conclude the researchers.\n\"Accurate up-to-date data on the survival and mortality rates of [early onset dementia] are crucial in designing health care structures, comprehensive patient care, and clinical trials,\" they add.\nMore information: Survival and mortality rates in early onset dementia, Journal of Neurology Neurosurgery & Psychiatry (2025).

Meanwhile, the COVID-19 vaccination was only linked to a short-term higher risk of myocarditis and pericarditis.\nThe study is the largest of its kind in this population, and is published in The Lancet Child and Adolescent Health. It was led by scientists at the Universities of Cambridge and Edinburgh, and University College London, with support from the BHF Data Science Center at Health Data Research UK.\nPrincipal author Dr. Alexia Sampri, University of Cambridge, said, \"Our whole-population study during the pandemic showed that although these conditions were rare, children and young people were more likely to experience heart, vascular or inflammatory problems after a COVID-19 infection than after having the vaccine—and the risks after infection lasted much longer.\"\nThe research team uncovered these findings by analyzing linked electronic health records (EHRs) for nearly 14 million children in England under the age of 18 between 1 January 2020 and 31 December 2022, covering 98% of this population.\nDuring this period, 3.9 million children and young people had a first COVID-19 diagnosis. And 3.4 million had a first COVID-19 BNT162b2 (Pfizer–BioNTech) vaccine, the main vaccine used in 5–18-year-olds during the study period.\nAll personal information that could identify individuals had been stripped away, and approved researchers accessed this data entirely within the NHS England Secure Data Environment (SDE), a secure data and analysis platform.\nThe study looked at short- and long-term risks of rare complications including arterial and venous thrombosis (clots in blood vessels), thrombocytopenia (low levels of platelets in the blood), myocarditis or pericarditis (inflammation of the heart and its surrounding tissue respectively), and inflammatory conditions after COVID-19 diagnosis or vaccination.\nAfter a first COVID-19 diagnosis, risks of the five conditions studied were highest in the first four weeks and, for several conditions, stayed higher for up to 12 months, compared to children and young people without or before a diagnosis.\nIn contrast, after COVID-19 vaccination, the team only saw a short-term higher risk of myocarditis or pericarditis in the first four weeks, compared to children and young people without or before vaccination. After that, the risk returned to the same level as the start of the study period.\nOver six months, the research team estimated that COVID-19 infection led to 2.24 extra cases of myocarditis or pericarditis per 100,000 children and young people who had COVID-19. In those who were vaccinated, there were only 0.85 extra cases per 100,000 children and young people.\nPrevious research showed that children and young people diagnosed with COVID-19 are at a higher risk of developing conditions like myocarditis, pericarditis, and thrombocytopenia, compared to their peers who hadn't had a COVID-19 diagnosis.\nWhile many studies show that COVID-19 vaccines can help children to avoid severe illness and hospitalization, some also report rare cases of myocarditis in young people shortly after receiving a COVID-19 vaccine, particularly for mRNA-based vaccines.\nHowever, there hasn't been any research directly comparing the longer-term risks of both COVID-19 diagnosis and vaccinations in children and young people until now.\nCo-author Professor Pia Hardelid, UCL and National Institute of Health and Care Research Great Ormond Street Hospital Biomedical Research Center, said, \"Parents and caregivers have faced difficult choices throughout the pandemic. By building a stronger evidence base on both infection and vaccination outcomes, we hope to support families and health care professionals to make decisions grounded in the best available data.\"\nCo-author Professor Angela Wood, University of Cambridge and Associate Director at the BHF Data Science Center, said, \"Using electronic health records from all children and young people in England, we were able to study very rare but serious heart and clotting complications, and found higher and longer-lasting risks after COVID-19 infection than after vaccination.\n\"While vaccine-related risks are likely to remain rare and short-lived, future risks following infection could change as new variants emerge and immunity shifts. That's why whole-population health data monitoring remains essential to guide vaccine and other important public health decisions.\"\nCo-author Professor William Whiteley, University of Edinburgh and Associate Director at the BHF Data Science Center, said, \"Parents, young people, and children need reliable information to make decisions about their health. Data from hospitals and GP practices are an important part of the picture because they tell us all what has happened to people looked after in the NHS.\n\"Here we have shown that during the pandemic, risks of myocarditis and inflammatory illnesses were low for children and young people, and that they were less after COVID-19 vaccination than after COVID-19 infection.\"\nMore information: Vascular and inflammatory diseases after COVID-19 infection and vaccination in children and young people in England: a retrospective, population-based cohort study using linked electronic health records, The Lancet Child & Adolescent Health (2025).

When applied to 3D tumor models, the effect propagates to adjacent cells, inducing cell death in the core of the tumor that progressively extends throughout its structure.\nPhotodynamic therapy is a clinically approved cancer treatment that relies on light irradiation of tumor areas where a photosensitizing agent has been previously administered. Light activation releases toxic compounds aimed at inducing the death of cancer cells. Typically, irradiation is applied to the entire tumor. Researchers now propose an innovative approach: focused laser irradiation on individual tumor cells.\nThe research is published in the journal Advanced Therapeutics.\nUsing clinically approved photosensitizing agents, the researchers demonstrated that focused laser irradiation causes selective damage to cancer cells in culture. By irradiating cells with a pinpoint light, they perforated the cell membranes, inducing the death of the targeted cell with high precision. Within less than a minute, the researchers were able to observe cell death in real time under a microscope.\nThe most striking aspect of this study was the observation that the effect extended to adjacent cells. To investigate this, the researchers used tumor spheroids—3D cell cultures that mimic the actual organization of cells in tumors. Cells within the spheroid were irradiated, and for the first time, it was observed that neighboring non-irradiated cells also died due to the so-called bystander effect.\nThe bystander effect is a phenomenon previously described in radiotherapy and also observed in photodynamic therapies, where stress signals from a damaged cell induce the death of neighboring non-irradiated cells. The researchers observed that after the pinpoint light irradiation, cell death spread throughout the entire tumor spheroid in culture within 10 minutes.\nDr. Sebastián Thompson, senior author, said, \"The fact that we present this proof of concept using both markers and light already used clinically opens up an immense range of applications, since only the method of irradiating the tumor changes. This creates a much more favorable scenario for future tests in animal models. Photodynamic therapy is already in clinical use, and in the areas where it is applied—lung cancer, brain tumors, etc.—it could potentially support future applications.\n\"With this technique, we are inducing cell death from within the tumor spheroid, a scenario as counterintuitive as it is fascinating. For this reason, we are also theoretically investigating this phenomenon, which we have explored experimentally.\"\nCristina Carrizo, the study's first author, said, \"The next steps will be to determine the limits of the bystander effect, ensure healthy cells are not damaged, and identify the tumor sizes to which this new technique could be applied to define future tests in animal models.\"\nIn summary, the study presents a new technique within photodynamic therapy that uses clinically approved photosensitizing agents and can destroy tumor spheroids from the inside in a highly precise, cell-by-cell manner. This new concept in photodynamic therapy could be combined with other therapies or surgeries to help achieve complete cancer eradication.\nThe study opens new perspectives in the fight against aggressive tumors such as glioblastoma, achieving highly selective and efficient treatment. The results suggest that this single-point photodynamic therapy could become a promising complement to current oncological treatments.\nMore information: Cristina S.

When rapid acceleration or deceleration of the brain inside the skull occurs with a blow to the head, a concussion happens, which in some cases can lead to lasting impacts on motor and cognitive skills needed to keep athletes at the top of their game.\n\"You can think of concussions, or mild traumatic brain injuries, as a software problem more than a hardware problem,\" said Susan Mingils, Ph.D., a research services senior professional in physical medicine and rehabilitation at CU Anschutz. \"It's more about looking at how the brain is processing information and functioning at that cellular level rather than these obvious structural changes you see in moderate or severe traumatic brain injuries.\"\nMingils was part of a study looking at how concussions impact reaction time—vital to athletes' performance and safety. The paper is published in the journal Archives of Clinical Neuropsychology.\nIn the following Q&A, Mingils explains how concussions are diagnosed, the challenges scientists face in studying them and what the research showed when looking at reaction times, sex differences and recovery.\nHow are concussions diagnosed and measured?\nConcussions, also known as mild traumatic brain injuries, are typically diagnosed based on the symptoms that show up within minutes to hours after the injury and the severity of those symptoms, including:\n- Headache\n- Balance problems\n- Sensitivity to light and sound\n- Disorientation\n- A feeling like being in a fog\n- Emotional changes, such as irritability\n- In more severe cases, nausea, tunnel vision and loss of consciousness lasting under 30 minutes.\nTraumatic brain injury severity is measured using scales, such as the Glasgow Coma Scale. Other assessments, such as the Concussion Recognition Tool—help non-medically trained people to identify and manage concussions to help determine whether or not to remove an athlete from play.\nWhy is it important to study the effects of concussions on younger athletes?\nThey are vulnerable to concussions in two ways. First, their brains are developing, so their physiology is going to respond to a concussion differently. Missing time from school or their activities due to a concussion will also have a negative impact on their mental and physical health. Second, they are a more vulnerable population and may be less likely to advocate for themselves and what they need to recover.\nWhy do researchers specify 'sports-related' concussions?\nThese are caused during a sport or a sport-related activity, rather than something like a fall or a car accident—which are other common causes of mild traumatic brain injury or concussion.\nThere are a few reasons to make the distinction:\n- It's one of the most common causes of concussion in youth and young adults.\n- They can be a unique type of injury, especially when we talk about repeated sub-concussive injuries.\n- Findings about sports-related concussions go back into the sports themselves to create better safety guidelines.\nThese distinctions are why we need to have studies that specifically look at this unique population within sports.\nWhat is the hardest part about studying concussions, especially with sports-related concussions?\nIt's complex and nuanced because a lot of the symptoms of concussion are not specific to concussions. There's a range in severity of symptoms and duration—and we're still figuring out why that is.\nFurthermore, there's pressure on athletes to perform, and studies have reported there is a tendency to underreport symptoms.\nYou used something called the Automated Neuropsychological Assessment Metrics in the study. Can you explain what it is?\nIt's a battery of several different tests that measure a range of cognitive skills—reaction time, inhibition, visual-spatial skills, memory, attention and more. It's also flexible to administer, because you can do it on a tablet in training rooms.\nFor the simple reaction time test, you click or press a button every time an image appears on the screen, usually an asterisk or something similar. The amount of time between each image appearing is randomized.\nWhy is studying reaction times important?\nReaction time is really one of the most basic motor functions or cognitive functions that we have, so it's really important for the foundation of a lot of other skills. For athletes especially, even slightly slower reaction times can make a really big difference on the field where there's a lot of decisions to make very quickly.\nDecreased reaction times can lead to an increased risk for injury, either another concussion or some kind of musculoskeletal injury. So even small differences can make a big impact.\nPost-concussion, how long does it take for reaction times to reset back to that baseline?\nIt varies by person. I would say that normally between two and four weeks, you'd expect, just in general, symptoms and performance to be back at baseline. But it's important to have athletes do a baseline test at the beginning of the season, so then they can compare their performance after concussion.\nOn a physiological level, why are concussions impacting reaction times?\nI think it's something we're still investigating, but we have a pretty good idea. One reason is that the brain will swell after the injury, so there's inflammation. That inflammation can just cause delayed thinking in general, slower reaction times.\nAnd then in recent studies, there's a lot more evidence showing that the movement of the brain in the skull during a concussion can cause the axons of the neurons to stretch or tear. If they are broken like that, it can slow down reaction and processing times.\nYou did a study on reaction times among high school athletes with and without a history of concussion. What did you find?\nWe found that those athletes who had had multiple past concussions—those who reported having two or more concussions in their life—seemed like they were less likely to be able to sustain their performance over time, and, for some, their reaction times slowed to a noticeable degree.\nAnd comparatively, those who only had one or no concussions were less likely to lose their performance and able to keep up their reaction time speed.\nThis test was mostly conducted with football players, so we need to look at expanding this line of research to bigger sample sizes and more complex situations—such as other cognitive tasks that mimic the sport being played. I also think we need some neuroimaging studies to understand what's happening in the brain when we're seeing these differences in behavior.\nYou also studied sex differences and concussion injuries in high school and collegiate athletes. What were the findings?\nWe did find some evidence around inhibition.\nIn females with a history of concussion, there was more likely to be increased inhibition. On the other hand, males with a history of concussion were more likely to have decreased inhibition.\nIn other words, males with a history of concussion were more likely to take risks. Some prior studies have found that women athletes may be more likely to have kinesiophobia—fear of movement—post-concussion. There's a fear of re-injury. That may be why we are seeing that increase in inhibition. We'll need more data, but it's an interesting trend.\nAdditionally, there's some evidence that females take longer to recover from a concussion. In fact, female athletes in our study reported longer recovery times following their most recent concussion compared to male athletes.\nAs someone who's studied the brain and the impact that these injuries have on the brain, do you have any advice or things that you would say to parents or coaches to help them around this topic of concussions?\nI think we're moving in a good direction overall. The past decade has seen increased awareness and understanding around concussions and recovery.\nFor parents, I'd recommend they check out the HEADS UP training and information. These are part of the guidelines for college athletics, but these free resources are great for parents, coaches or anyone working with young athletes.\nAs long as we keep those around a sports team educated and aware of concussion research, I think we'll do a better job protecting young people's brains and health.\nUltimately, we'll do the most good if we can keep building collaborative relationships between researchers and athletes, trainers and coaches to gain more insight into concussions.\nMore information: Erika K Osherow et al, The Effect of Youth Concussion History on Preseason Reaction Time Performance on a Computerized Neuropsychological Test Battery, Archives of Clinical Neuropsychology (2025).

This is the reality for thousands of people with temporomandibular disorder (TMD), a condition affecting the joint responsible for opening and closing the mouth, as well as the chewing muscles. For these individuals, constant jaw, temple, facial, or ear pain; difficulty chewing; and headaches can affect their daily routine and mental health.\nA study conducted at the Ribeirão Preto School of Nursing at the University of São Paulo (EERP-USP) in Brazil has shown that regularly practicing mindfulness, a meditation technique involving focus and full attention, can help reduce pain sensitivity and improve emotional regulation in these individuals.\nThe results are published in the Journal of Oral Rehabilitation.\nThe research was conducted at the Center for Mindfulness and Integrative Therapies at the University of São Paulo. The study was led by Edilaine Gherardi Donato, a nurse and full professor at EERP-USP, who coordinated the team.\nAccording to Gherardi-Donato, the study aimed to understand whether practicing mindfulness could alleviate chronic pain associated with TMD and improve multiple factors involved, including neurophysiological and psychological aspects such as stress, anxiety, and \"pain catastrophizing.\" Pain catastrophizing occurs when a person focuses solely on their pain, amplifying their negative perception of it as if it were uncontrollable and unbearable.\n\"One of the human conditions that causes a lot of psychological suffering and undermines mental health is living with pain. Pain causes constant stress, both physically and mentally,\" the researcher explains. \"When we promote mental health through care strategies that connect the body and mind, we prevent illness and promote quality of life for the population.\"\nAccording to Gherardi-Donato, TMD is two to three times more prevalent in women than in men and can progress to chronic pain lasting three to six months, even at rest and after conservative treatment. TMD compromises function, impairs sleep and mood, and can cause hyperalgesia, an exaggerated response to painful stimuli.\nIn these situations, the body goes into a state of alert, the brain becomes sensitized, and the perception of pain increases, affecting not only the jaw region, but also other parts of the body.\n\"These indicators show that pain is no longer just a joint problem, but has become a phenomenon of central nervous system modulation, requiring a multidimensional approach,\" the researcher says.\nIn the randomized clinical trial, the researcher and her team observed 53 women, aged 18 to 61, diagnosed with chronic TMD. The women were recruited from the specialized service of the Ribeirão Preto School of Dentistry (FORP-USP), a project partner, as well as through advertising in health institutions and on social media.\nHalf of the women participated in an eight-week mindfulness program consisting of weekly two-hour face-to-face meetings and a four-hour outdoor session. Participants also received audio recordings of the mindfulness practices learned during the meetings and guidance on how to practice the techniques daily at home. The control group did not receive any intervention during the same period and was monitored to ensure that they did not start any other type of treatment.\n\"In our research, we only evaluated women because they're more affected by the problem and have hormonal variability that could influence the findings. We looked at cases of chronic painful TMD, that is, people who had been living with pain for an extended period and exhibited the typical signs of chronicity. These women are also more predisposed to feeling pain in different regions of the body due to the involvement of peripheral and central sensitization mechanisms because the nervous system is constantly on alert,\" the researcher explains.\nThe mindfulness program was adapted to Brazilian culture. It began with five-minute practices, which gradually increased to 30 minutes daily over the weeks. Activities included formal exercises such as focusing on breathing, body sensations, thoughts, and emotions; as well as different postures such as sitting, lying down, moving, and walking meditation. The program also included informal practices aimed at bringing awareness to routine tasks such as brushing teeth, eating, getting dressed, and washing dishes.\n\"You can't expect someone who has never practiced mindfulness to be able to meditate for half an hour right away. Progression is essential for a person to learn what it means to be present in their body and emotions without judgment. The practice should be comfortable, easy, simple, and natural,\" Gherardi-Donato explains.\nAfter eight weeks, the women who participated in the program showed significant improvement in their pain pressure threshold. This means they could tolerate more stimuli before beginning to feel pain. There was also a reduction in painful points throughout the body, decreased stress, and less pain catastrophizing.\n\"These women reported decreased pain and were less sensitive to mild painful stimuli that were present before the intervention and were uncomfortable. There was a reduction in orofacial pain points and pressure pain in the facial and body regions,\" the researcher reports.\n\"They also developed greater control of their attention, managing to put the pain into perspective. The pain was still present, but it no longer occupied 100% of their attention, making room for self-care and dealing more consciously with the negative emotions and thoughts that accompany and intensify it,\" she explains.\nAnother important finding of the study was the improvement in body awareness and emotional regulation. According to Gherardi-Donato, the practice helped participants cope with challenging sensations more effectively. \"The mind of someone who experiences chronic pain tends to ruminate, feeding the fear that the pain will only get worse. This increases stress and the risk of anxiety and depression. With the practice of mindfulness, women begin to recognize pain as something impermanent that doesn't have to dominate their lives.\"\nWhile the study did not reveal significant changes in anxiety or depression symptoms, Gherardi-Donato notes that the observed benefits in reducing stress and anxiety, improving pain perception, and strengthening cognitive and attentional abilities are significant.\nLow cost and available in the public health system\nThe results reinforce the idea that integrative and complementary health practices such as mindfulness can be an important tool in managing chronic pain, especially complex conditions like TMD. Additionally, mindfulness is a low-cost practice that is easy to implement and incorporate into public health services.\n\"Mindfulness, as a type of meditation, has been included in the National Policy on Integrative and Complementary Practices of the SUS [acronym for \"Sistema Único de Saúde,\" Brazil's national public health system] since 2017 [Ordinance No. 849] This means that it can and should be offered as accessible care to the population, representing an expansion of the care model,\" she points out.\nAccording to the researcher, mindfulness has an impact that goes beyond physical relief by promoting a change in attitude toward life.\n\"The program restores essential cognitive and emotional skills and improves self-knowledge and self-care. People learn to sustain their attention for longer and access this state of presence in their daily activities as well. It isn't just about sitting and meditating, but about compassionately contemplating the broad range of our experiences, making more conscious choices, and living more consciously in our daily lives, moment by moment,\" she concludes.\nMore information: Melissa de Oliveira Melchior et al, Impact of a Mindfulness‐Based Intervention on Pain and Psychological Factors in Women With Chronic Painful Temporomandibular Disorders, Journal of Oral Rehabilitation (2025).

A new study from UC San Francisco shows that this trend extends to nursing home residents who may need opioids to manage chronic pain.\nAnalyzing data on nearly 3 million U.S. nursing home residents between 2011 and 2022, researchers found the probability of receiving an opioid declined across the board, even for nursing home residents with severe chronic pain.\nThe study, which uses data from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), is the first to examine opioid prescribing trends in nursing homes and to examine these trends by race, ethnicity, and pain level. It appears in JAMA Internal Medicine.\nIn 2016, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released opioid guidelines designed to reduce overprescribing in outpatient care. This seems to have unintentionally shifted prescribing practices in other settings.\n\"Older adults in nursing homes really shouldn't be as impacted by the CDC opioid guidelines,\" said the paper's first author, Ulrike Muench, Ph.D., associate professor in the Department of Social and Behavioral Sciences in the UCSF School of Nursing. \"The prevalence of chronic pain in nursing homes is high because of the multiple medical issues that often accompany older age, and these residents are not the ones most at risk for misusing these medications.\"\nThe chances of nursing home residents receiving any type of opioid dropped from 48% to 33.5%, but the researchers found the reduction was not felt equally. Black, Hispanic, Asian, and American Indian or Alaska Native residents were consistently less likely than white residents to receive opioids. They also were less likely to receive higher doses of opioids, no matter their level of pain.\nWhile the authors emphasized the importance of minimizing unnecessary opioid use, they noted that pain care is essential to healthy aging and maintaining quality of life.\n\"It really surprised us that even when people reported having very severe chronic pain, white nursing home residents were more likely to receive opioids—and receive them at higher doses than residents from other racial and ethnic groups,\" Muench said.\nMore information: Ulrike Muench et al, Opioid Prescribing Patterns in US Nursing Homes by Race and Ethnicity, JAMA Internal Medicine (2025).

The findings open new pathways for discoveries about mental illness, neurological disorders and other diseases related to defects in this part of the brain.\nThe corpus callosum is critical for nearly everything the brain does, from coordinating the movement of our limbs in sync to integrating sights and sounds, to higher-order thinking and decision-making. Abnormalities in its shape and size have long been linked to disorders such as ADHD, bipolar disorder, and Parkinson's disease. Until now, the genetic underpinnings of this vital structure had remained largely unknown.\nIn the new study, published in Nature Communications, the team analyzed brain scans and genetic data from over 50,000 people, ranging from childhood to late adulthood, with the help of a new tool the team created that leverages artificial intelligence.\n\"We developed an AI tool that finds the corpus callosum in different types of brain MRI scans and automatically takes its measurements,\" said Shruti P. Gadewar, co-first author of the study and research specialist at the Stevens INI. Using this tool, the researchers identified dozens of genetic regions that influence the size and thickness of the corpus callosum and its subregions.\n\"These findings provide a genetic blueprint for one of the brain's most essential communication pathways,\" said Ravi R. Bhatt, Ph.D., co-first author of the study and a postdoctoral scholar at the Stevens INI's Imaging Genetics Center. \"By uncovering how specific genes shape the corpus callosum and its subregions, we can start to understand why differences in this structure are linked to various mental health and neurological conditions at a molecular level.\"\nThe study revealed that different sets of genes govern the area versus the thickness of the corpus callosum—two features that change across the lifespan and play distinct roles in brain function. Several of the implicated genes are active during prenatal brain development, particularly in processes like cell growth, programmed cell death, and the wiring of nerve fibers across hemispheres.\n\"This work demonstrates the power of using AI and large-scale databases to uncover the genetic factors driving brain development,\" said Neda Jahanshad, Ph.D., associate professor of neurology and senior author. \"By linking genetics to brain structure, we gain critical insight into the biological pathways that may underlie psychiatric and neurological diseases.\"\nNotably, the study found genetic overlap between the corpus callosum and the cerebral cortex—the outer layer of the brain responsible for memory, attention, and language—as well as with conditions such as ADHD and bipolar disorder.\n\"These connections underscore that the same genetic factors shaping the brain's communication bridge may also contribute to vulnerabilities for certain disorders,\" Jahanshad added.\nArthur W. Toga, Ph.D., director of the Stevens INI, emphasized the broader implications of this research, stating, \"This study is a landmark in understanding how our brains are built. It not only sheds light on normal brain development but also helps us identify new avenues for diagnosing and potentially treating disorders that affect millions worldwide.\"\nThe researchers have made their new AI-based tool publicly available to accelerate future discoveries. The software, developed at the Stevens INI, uses advanced machine learning to identify and measure the corpus callosum from MRI scans automatically. This approach allows scientists to analyze brain structure at an unprecedented scale and level of precision, reducing years of manual work to just hours.\nThe Stevens INI has become a global leader in applying artificial intelligence to neuroscience, developing tools that are freely shared with the research community. By combining massive datasets with cutting-edge computational methods, the institute is transforming how scientists study brain health and disease.\n\"Artificial intelligence is revolutionizing brain research, and Stevens INI is at the forefront of that revolution,\" said Toga. \"By pioneering AI tools and making them widely available, we're empowering scientists around the world to unlock new discoveries about the brain far faster than ever before.\"\nMore information: Ravi R.

However, why they do that has remained unknown.\nAre they simply curious or is something missing in their ability to control attention?\nIn a new study, scientists at The Ohio State University have found out why—by forcing adults to behave just like children when trying to complete a task.\nThe answer to why children are easily distracted is that their working memory isn't developed enough to hold the task goals in mind and control attention. And without such control, attention has no single target and is diffused, said Vladimir Sloutsky, co-author of the study and professor of psychology at Ohio State.\nSuch behavior comes across as overexploring.\nSloutsky and lead author Qianqian Wan, a former Ohio State doctoral student in psychology and currently a postdoctoral researcher at the University of California-Davis, got adults to behave like children by overloading their working memories while they were trying to complete a task.\n\"We made it difficult for adults to focus by filling their working memory with things that weren't relevant to what they were trying to accomplish,\" Sloutsky said. \"And when we did that, adults began to overexplore and scatter their attention much like children do.\"\n\"Importantly, like in children, this scattered attention was observed, despite high levels of task accuracy,\" Wan added.\nThe study was published this week in the Journal of Experimental Psychology: General.\nOne experiment involved 40 5-year-old children and 71 adults.\nThe children and adults participated in a game on a computer or touch screen in which they collected virtual candy from four alien creatures.\nEach creature consistently delivered a fixed number of candies—1, 2, 3 or 10—but participants did not know this in advance, so they weren't sure as they were playing if the amounts would stay the same.\nThe goal was simple: Earn as much candy as possible. The creatures moved during the game, so participants couldn't rely on location to determine where they could get the most candy.\nBut some of the adults in the study had an additional task, one that was designed to tax their working memory. This secondary assignment required participants to monitor a continuous stream of numbers on the screen. Whenever two odd numbers appeared in a row, they had to verbally identify the second odd number.\nAfter the study, the researchers asked all participants, adults and children, if they could identify which creature gave the highest reward. And all participants had above-chance accuracy in choosing the correct creature. That shows that both children and adults learned what creature would help them reach their goal of collecting the most candy.\nStill, some participants continued to select other creatures, even though they learned which one gave the most.\n\"As we expected from previous research, the children were generally slower to start selecting the most rewarding creature and switched creatures much more often than the adults who weren't asked to do an additional task,\" Wan said.\n\"But the adults who were under the working memory load behaved much like the children, not settling on the most rewarding creature. It is compelling evidence that an undeveloped working memory is behind children's tendency to distribute their attention.\"\nSimilarly, when adults were given learning tasks under working memory load, just like young children, they showed successful learning coupled with distributed attention.\nHow is working memory a part of how children and adults allocate their attention while completing tasks?\nSloutsky said research suggests working memory is involved in the active maintenance and updating of \"attentional maps,\" or mental models that guide information sampling.\n\"These maps may guide attention to what is deemed important, allow selective information sampling and more efficient task performance,\" Wan said.\n\"But if you don't have sufficient working memory resources, these maps become harder to form and maintain. The result is that you have to broaden your attention to compensate for uncertainty.\"\nOverloading the adults' working memory results in the same problems with attention that come with children's underdeveloped working memory.\nThe results suggest that children's \"distractible\" behavior isn't a flaw, but reflects the natural consequences of their developing memory system, Sloutsky said.\nThis tendency to be easily distracted from the task at hand and overexplore the environment may actually help children notice what adults miss and learn in more flexible ways than typical adults do.\n\"These findings could inform teaching strategies that work with, rather than against, young children's natural learning tendencies,\" Wan said.\nMore information: Qianqian Wan et al, Working memory shapes information sampling and attention allocation across development., Journal of Experimental Psychology: General (2025).

A new study published in the International Journal on Child Maltreatment: Research, Policy and Practice finds that parental emotional support helps protect children from anxiety and distress—even when parents themselves suffer from trauma. By encouraging open conversations and validating emotions, parents create a safe space that strengthens children's resilience in the face of conflict.\nThe study, conducted by Dr. Mor Kleynikov and Prof. Dana Lassri from the Hebrew University, Prof. Noga Cohen, and Dr. Joy Benatov from the University of Haifa, together with Prof. Reuma Gadassi-Polack from Bar-Ilan University and Yale University, reveals that the way parents help their children regulate emotions, such as encouraging conversations about feelings, legitimizing emotional expression, finding solutions, or promoting distraction, can protect children from the negative effects of war, even when the parents themselves experience post-traumatic symptoms.\nThe data were collected about a month after the October 7, 2023, terrorist attack during the Israel–Hamas war and included 318 parents of children aged 5–18 (76% women; average age: 40). Most participants reported significant exposure to the war:\n- 32% reported a rocket landing in their area\n- 28% lost a relative\n- 16% were partners of reservists\n- 6% experienced an immediate threat to their lives\nKey findings\n- 28% of parents met the clinical diagnostic threshold for PTSD.\n- The more severe the parents' PTSD symptoms, the more likely their children were to experience emotional and behavioral difficulties such as anxiety, aggression, sleep problems, and psychosomatic symptoms.\n- Interpersonal Emotion Regulation (IER)—the way parents help their children manage emotions—significantly reduced the strength of this connection. Even among parents with high levels of PTSD symptoms, children of parents who used adaptive emotion regulation strategies reported fewer difficulties.\n- Results showed that while there was a strong link between parental PTSD symptoms and children's emotional and behavioral problems at low levels of parental IER, this link was much weaker when parents employed high levels of interpersonal emotion regulation.\nParents are central to their children's resilience. The study found that even when they themselves are traumatized, they can still serve as an emotional resource for their children. The more parents encouraged open emotional dialog, legitimized negative emotions, and helped find solutions, the more resilient their children were.\nThe novelty of this study lies in its optimistic message: the positive connection between supportive parenting and children's well-being persists even when parents themselves are traumatized. You don't need to be a \"perfect parent\" to protect your child—what matters most is the parent's ability to listen and give space to feelings.\n\"The study shows that there is something we can do, even under harsh conditions,\" the researchers explain. \"It is possible to provide parents with practical tools to support their children emotionally, and thereby prevent psychological decline in an entire generation.\"\nThe study highlights how family relationships can serve as a powerful protective factor. Even in situations of severe external threat, the emotional bond between parent and child can become a safe space that allows the child to cope with an impossible reality.\nThe findings emphasize the importance of investing in trauma-informed parenting programs—accessible, evidence-based tools that can make a real difference in children's well-being, not only during war but also in times of ongoing stress.\nThe researchers recommend integrating the study's findings into educational and therapeutic programs for parents living in conflict zones as part of a trauma-informed approach. Incorporating adaptive interpersonal emotion regulation techniques can provide everyday emotional support and reduce the long-term effects of trauma on children.\nMore information: Mor Keleynikov et al, Parental PTSD and Children's Well-Being During Wartime: The Role of Interpersonal Emotion Regulation, International Journal on Child Maltreatment: Research, Policy and Practice (2025).

This is evident, for example, in diseases such as childhood blindness, which can be prevented through vaccinations or vitamin A supplements. However, eye diseases such as cataracts and glaucoma cannot be prevented. Only early diagnosis and surgery can protect affected children from going blind.\nIn a discussion paper published today by the German National Academy of Sciences Leopoldina, the authors therefore recommend that German development cooperation should focus on both strengthening treatment and maintaining a strong emphasis on prevention; an approach they refer to as Global Clinical Care.\nThe paper, \"Focus on childhood blindness—Rethinking prevention and treatment,\" illustrates these proposals with practical examples from southern Africa.\nBetween 1 million and 1.5 million children worldwide are blind. Almost a quarter of them live in Africa. The most common cause of blindness there is cataracts, which can only be treated surgically. Using the example of childhood blindness, the authors of the discussion paper show how a balanced global health policy can combine prevention and treatment to achieve positive effects on life satisfaction as well as on society and the economy.\nThey describe the progression of congenital cataracts in children and how targeted treatment can prevent childhood blindness. This enables children to attend regular school and later pursue a career. In the discussion paper, the scientists explain how treatment can also impact gross national product, and how the investments necessary to establish health care provision pay off both socially and economically.\nThe Global Clinical Care approach aims to create local self-help structures. In the case of childhood blindness, this means identifying affected children at an early stage, strengthening local care capacities and providing further training for ophthalmic specialists. From the authors' point of view, institutionalized partnerships are a key instrument for this.\nThe discussion paper presents two partnerships as examples: a partnership between Rostock/Germany and Kinshasa/Democratic Republic of Congo and a partnership between Tübingen/Germany and Blantyre/Malawi. Health care structures were established within the framework of these partnerships. Specialists were trained both locally and during stays in Germany.\nAccording to the authors, these long-term partnerships have the potential to strengthen sustainable health care provision locally. They therefore recommend that the German government, in continuing its Global Health Strategy, place greater emphasis on the connection between prevention and treatment and, among other things, provide a framework program for state funding of institutionalized partnerships.\nMore information: Focus on childhood blindness—Rethinking prevention and treatment. www.leopoldina.org/en/publicat … -and-treatment-2025/", "summary": "(summarizer_error: 401 Client Error: Unauthorized for url: https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions)"}

Caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, the condition damages heart tissue over time, resulting in inflammation, scarring (fibrosis), and heart failure. Even after the acute phase, the infection can progress silently for decades, eventually causing serious complications, such as arrhythmia, embolism, and sudden death.\nThe strain technique is an advanced echocardiography method that measures GLS by tracking bright spots in cardiac images (speckle tracking). This index can identify whether the myocardium is deforming properly during systole (contraction), which is a crucial sign of cardiac tissue damage, even before fibrosis becomes evident.\n\"When the myocardium isn't deforming properly, this suggests fibrosis in the tissue. Therefore, although GLS doesn't directly visualize fibrosis in cardiac tissue, it predicts its presence among the heart's muscle cells [myocytes], which signals a high risk of future complications,\" explains Minna Moreira Dias Romano, professor at the Ribeirão Preto School of Medicine at USP.\nIn the study, echocardiography tests from 77 patients with chronic Chagas disease were analyzed. The patients were followed for approximately three years. Patients were divided into three groups based on GLS values, and outcomes evaluated included death, hospitalizations, sustained ventricular tachycardia, new cases of heart failure, and cardioembolic events.\nThe results showed that patients with a GLS of -13.8% or greater (indicating greater compromise) had a worse prognosis, with a higher incidence of death and complications. Even after adjusting for age, sex, and left ventricular ejection fraction (the percentage of blood pumped by the left ventricle with each beat), the researchers found that GLS remained a statistically significant independent predictor of risk.\n\"This technique is already used in several other heart diseases, such as in cancer patients to monitor damage to the heart caused by chemotherapy, as in cases of breast cancer. Now, the study suggests that the same method can be applied to track the progression of Chagas disease, especially in places where diagnosis is rare, such as in geographic regions with a low prevalence of the disease,\" the researcher explained.\nRomano points out that previous studies have validated other indexes for the early detection of cardiac complications resulting from Chagas disease, but have not yet proven the role of GLS as an independent prognosticator.\nOne of the validated methods for predicting the risk of chronic heart disease caused by Chagas disease is the Rassi score. Developed by a Brazilian researcher, the score evaluates six variables to predict the long-term prognosis of patients with Chagas disease.\n\"It's already been validated, but it still leaves a margin of risk among intermediate cases, that is, those that aren't classified as high or low risk,\" says Romano.\nThe most accurate method for detecting myocardial fibrosis is cardiac magnetic resonance imaging with contrast (gadolinium). However, this expensive test is not widely available and can cause patient discomfort, such as claustrophobia.\nOn the other hand, echocardiography using GLS is cheaper, can be repeated as many times as necessary, and can be applied on a large scale. \"It's a risk marker that can be widely applied, especially in places where the diagnosis of Chagas heart disease is still rare,\" Romano emphasizes.\nDespite the good news, there are still challenges to implementing GLS on a large scale. Although the technique is accessible, it requires technical knowledge and specialized interpretation.\n\"The technique is more complex than conventional laboratory tests, such as biochemical assays. Even so, it represents a significant advance in risk stratification and monitoring the progression of chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy, offering health care professionals a powerful tool for making more accurate clinical decisions,\" Romano concludes.\nMore information: Minna Moreira Dias Romano et al, Global longitudinal strain as a predictor of outcomes in chronic Chagas´ cardiomyopathy, PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases (2025).

But researchers at the University of Missouri believe one key metric has been overlooked: blood viscosity, or how thick or sticky blood is as it flows through the body. Now they've developed a breakthrough technology to monitor it non-invasively and in real time.\nTheir paper is published in the Journal of Dynamic Systems, Measurement, and Control.\nViscosity plays a hidden but crucial role in health. It's linked to six of the top 10 leading causes of death in the United States, including heart disease, cancer and stroke.\nThick, sluggish blood forces the heart to work harder and can raise the risk of clots or tissue damage, said Nilesh Salvi, a research scientist in Mizzou's College of Agriculture, Food and Natural Resources and lead author on the project.\n\"Blood pressure tells us what's happening to the vessel walls,\" he said. \"But it doesn't tell us about the blood itself. Viscosity could be that missing piece.\"\nThe first-of-its-kind device uses ultrasound waves to measure blood viscosity in real time—but the true innovation lies in its software. The system works by gently vibrating blood with a continuous sound wave—meaning it sends a steady sound wave through the blood while simultaneously sensing its response. Then, a powerful algorithm analyzes how the sound moves through the body.\nAt its core, the invention is driven by advanced math and signal processing. This approach improves accuracy and, for the first time, enables the simultaneous measurement of both blood density and viscosity using the same signal.\nFrom motor engines to human health\nThis innovative tool wasn't originally designed for medicine.\nSalvi, who earned his master's degree and Ph.D. at Mizzou's College of Engineering, initially designed the system to monitor oil quality in engines. Building on that invention, he founded a startup company developing engine sensors to monitor lubricants in real time.\nWith guidance from his mentor, Jinglu Tan, a professor of chemical and biomedical engineering, Salvi began exploring how the same sensing principles could be used to study biological fluids. Tan's expertise helped him refine and strengthen the science behind this new direction.\nSeeing the medical potential, William Fay, a professor of medical pharmacology and physiology in Mizzou's School of Medicine, was one of the first people to encourage Salvi to explore the technology's clinical uses. His guidance helped Salvi and his team link their engineering work to biomedical research.\n\"Measuring blood viscosity has always been a challenge,\" Fay said. \"Specialized lab equipment is needed, and most hospitals don't have it. This new device could be a game changer—it allows accurate, real-time viscosity readings without ever drawing blood.\"\nTraditionally, blood viscosity is determined by taking blood samples—a process that can alter the blood's natural properties. By contrast, the Mizzou device measures viscosity inside the body, thus capturing its true behavior.\n\"Blood is a living organ,\" Tan, who also serves as director of strategic initiatives at the College of Agriculture, Food and Natural Resources, said. \"You can't take it out and expect it to behave the same way. Measuring it in the body—in situ—is what makes our approach so powerful.\"\nThe work could revolutionize how doctors manage diseases such as sickle cell anemia, where irregularly shaped blood cells increase viscosity and threaten organ health. Continuous monitoring could help tailor transfusions or medications to each patient's real-time needs, instead of relying on scheduled intervals.\nA new look inside the body\nResearchers are continuing their studies in hopes of preparing for human trials. Salvi's long-term goal is to make blood viscosity a standard vital sign—alongside heart rate and oxygen levels.\nSince the invention is mostly software-based, it can operate on inexpensive hardware, Salvi said. A prototype could also be built with readily available parts, opening the door to affordable, portable devices—and possibly future wearable health technology.\n\"This isn't just a new device,\" he said. \"It's a new way of thinking about the human body. Once we can see viscosity in real time, we'll understand blood flow and disease progression in ways we never could before.\"\nMore information: Nilesh Salvi et al, A Model-Based Method for In Situ Viscosity Measurement With Continuous-Wave Ultrasound, Journal of Dynamic Systems, Measurement, and Control (2025).

However, the findings also highlight the issue of overdiagnosis, or the detection of slow-growing cancers that are unlikely to affect a patient's lifespan, associated with PSA screening. To address this concern, the researchers advocate the development of risk-based screening.\nThe European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC) sheds new light on the long-term impact of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening on prostate cancer mortality.\nThe study, published in New England Journal of Medicine, found that PSA screening results in a 13% relative reduction in prostate cancer mortality 23 years after the start of screening.\n\"Long-term follow-up demonstrates that PSA screening can substantially reduce deaths from prostate cancer,\" says Anssi Auvinen, Professor of Epidemiology at Tampere University. \"Yet, the effect starts to wane once screening is discontinued and largely disappears within nine years.\"\nAuvinen is one of the principal investigators of the study and oversees the trial conducted in Finland as part of the multicenter ERSPC.\nThe study discovered that with PSA screening, one death from prostate cancer was prevented for every 456 men invited for screening and for every 12 men diagnosed with the disease.\nHowever, the absolute benefit of PSA screening increased over time: one death was prevented for every 628 men invited for screening after 16 years of follow-up, but by the end of the study at 23 years, only 456 men needed to be invited to prevent one death.\nThe main drawback of PSA screening is the detection of clinically insignificant cancers. In some cases, PSA screening leads to overdiagnosis, which may ultimately cause more harm than benefit. Some prostate cancers are so slow-growing that they do not become symptomatic even if left untreated. Treating these indolent, low-risk cancers offers no benefit to patients, but the side effects of treatment may reduce their quality of life.\nRisk-based screening is more effective at detecting cancers that require treatment\nWithin the screening group, the PSA test led to a higher number of diagnosed low-risk cancers but fewer cases of advanced cancers. Elevated PSA levels were found in 16% of the participants in initial tests, but subsequent biopsies confirmed prostate cancer in only 24% of those men. As a result, the researchers noted that a considerable number of the tests and procedures may have been unnecessary.\nNevertheless, the PSA level determined by the screening test is an effective predictor of prostate cancer risk and the likelihood of death from the disease.\nSince the start of the ERSPC study in the mid-1990s, substantial progress has been made with risk-based screening approaches. For example, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can help to reduce overdiagnosis.\n\"Risk-based screening would enable the identification of men who are at the highest risk of developing a clinically significant prostate cancer,\" Auvinen says.\nMore than 160,000 men from eight European counties, with nearly half of them from Finland, participated in the study. The Finnish partners included Tampere University, Tampere University Hospital, the University of Helsinki, Helsinki University Hospital as well as the Finnish Cancer Registry. The study was led by the Erasmus University Medical Center in Rotterdam, the Netherlands.\nThere is currently no national screening program for prostate cancer in Finland, but the introduction of PSA screening has become a topic of health care policy debate. Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men. It is the second-leading cause of cancer death in men in Finland and the third-leading in Europe.\nMore information: Monique J.

He notes that the age range 21–24 is the peak onset period for cannabis use disorder, which involves the continued use of cannabis despite negative consequences such as social or interpersonal problems, failure to fulfill obligations at home, school or work, and using cannabis under physically dangerous circumstances such as while operating a motor vehicle.\n\"These and other findings suggest that age-informed, multilevel prevention efforts are needed,\" Kerr said. \"Communities would benefit from a range of policies that respond to the growing evidence that cannabis products and retail stores are marketed in ways that are appealing to young adults, many of whom live in areas with lots of retail access and who are more apt to buy high-potency products.\"\nAt the other end of the age spectrum, he said, perceptions about the risk of regular cannabis use have decreased in recent years, especially among people with chronic diseases who may use cannabis for medicinal purposes in ways that aren't evidence based or that introduce new health risks.\n\"It's a complicated picture,\" Kerr said. \"Because cannabis is considered effective for certain conditions like chronic pain, it poses less risk than opioids, and less drinking is better for your health than more drinking.\"\nKerr doubts people are choosing where they live based on the number of cannabis retailers nearby, but rather that increased access to retailers may influence residents' behavior.\nRetail sales of recreational cannabis products in Oregon began in 2015. State law allows counties and cities to ban retail cannabis operations, but county bans apply only to unincorporated areas.\n\"Retail access to cannabis products can be regulated through an array of approaches and enacted at different levels of government,\" Kerr said. \"Careful consideration should be given to policies and prevention efforts that balance the goals of cannabis legalization against potential harms.\"\nMore information: David C.R.

Understanding why some people develop it while others do not remains one of the main scientific challenges.\nA new study led by the Germans Trias i Pujol Research Institute (IGTP) provides a new perspective: what matters is not only which previous diseases a person has, but also the order in which they appeared and how they interact. This approach makes it possible to identify risk profiles for long COVID that had not been detected until now. The research was conducted within the framework of the COVICAT study, coordinated in collaboration with the Barcelona Institute for Global Health (ISGlobal).\nThe study, published in BMC Medicine, is based on data from more than 10,000 participants in the GCAT (Genomes for Life) cohort, which has collected clinical and genetic information from the Catalan population for over 15 years.\nUsing these data, linked to the prospective COVID follow-up of the COVICAT study launched in 2020, the research team reconstructed health trajectories -that is, the temporal sequence of different chronic diseases- to analyze how these may influence the development of long COVID.\nThe importance of disease sequence\nUntil now, most studies had focused on whether or not a person had a previous condition. This work shows that the sequence and interaction of diseases over time can also be key to predicting the risk of developing long COVID.\n\"It is not enough to know which diseases a person has. The order in which they appear can significantly influence risk, especially among women,\" explains Natàlia Blay, first author of the study.\nThe results show that taking into account the sequence and interaction of diseases over time allows for a more accurate prediction than considering only the presence of a single condition. For example, individuals with anxiety followed by depression have a different risk compared with those who experience the same conditions in the reverse order.\nIn total, 162 trajectories were analyzed, and 38 were associated with a significantly higher risk of long COVID. The most frequent trajectories involved mental health disorders, neurological, respiratory (such as asthma), and metabolic or digestive diseases (such as hypertension, obesity or reflux).\nThe analysis also reveals that some of these disease trajectories increase the risk of long COVID regardless of the severity of the initial infection. This indicates that not everything can be explained by the type or intensity of acute COVID. The researchers note that, in the future, this approach could benefit from artificial intelligence tools capable of detecting complex patterns in large longitudinal health datasets, thus improving the ability to predict risks and identify vulnerable population groups more precisely.\n\"This work demonstrates that long COVID results from a prior health trajectory rather than a single factor. Above all, it highlights that studying trajectories in longitudinal data such as those from GCAT has value beyond COVID, as it allows us to identify population health patterns that may help predict other diseases and support a more preventive and personalized public health approach,\" explains Rafael de Cid, principal investigator of the study and director of GCAT at IGTP.\nRegarding the genetic component, the study reveals no strong overall genetic correlation with long COVID, although modest relationships were found with genetic factors linked to neurological and musculoskeletal diseases. These findings suggest a possible shared susceptibility in certain cases.\nThe study reinforces the need to understand health as a dynamic and cumulative process. Incorporating the temporal sequence of diseases alongside genetic information can improve prediction, care and prevention for long COVID and other chronic conditions.\nMore information: Natalia Blay et al, Pre-pandemic disease trajectories and genetic insights into long COVID susceptibility, BMC Medicine (2025).

The device, called PRIME (Panoramically Reconfigurable IlluMinativE) fiber, delivers multi-site, reconfigurable optical stimulation through a single, hair-thin implant.\n\"By combining fiber-based techniques with optogenetics, we can achieve deep-brain stimulation at unprecedented scale,\" said Song Hu, a professor of biomedical engineering at McKelvey Engineering, who collaborated with the laboratory of Adam Kepecs, a professor of neuroscience and of psychiatry at WashU Medicine.\nOptical fibers power the field of optogenetics by using light-sensitive ion channels to control neurons in the deep brain, turning the cells on or off. But conventional fibers have limits: a single fiber can deliver light to only one destination.\nIn order to understand complex brain circuits, researchers need to deliver light to hundreds, if not thousands, of different points in the brain, and it's far too invasive to add a thousand optical fibers to handle that task.\nBut what if that single fiber could direct light into a thousand different directions, like a controllable disco ball in the brain?\nThat's precisely what the group set out to achieve. Hu's team, including postdoctoral researcher and first author Shuo Yang, who led the development of the PRIME technology, used ultrafast-laser 3D microfabrication to inscribe thousands of grating light emitters (acting as mirrors) into a fiber the width of a human hair. Meanwhile, Kepecs' team, including graduate student and co-first author Keran Yang and postdoctoral senior scientist Quentin Chevy, validated the technology by studying its neural modulation technique in freely behaving animal models.\nThese results, published in Nature Neuroscience, represent both a neurotechnology innovation and a fabrication breakthrough.\n\"We're carving very small light emitters into very small pieces,\" Shuo Yang said. \"Very small, meaning tiny mirrors that are 1/100th the size of a human hair.\"\nThe PRIME fiber connects light to neurons across different brain regions. In proof-of-concept studies in animal models, Keran Yang used PRIME to drive activity in subregions of the superior colliculus, a hub for sensorimotor transformation, and systematically induced freezing or escape behavior, depending on the reconfigurable light pattern.\n\"This kind of tool lets us ask questions that were impossible before,\" Keran Yang said. \"By precisely shaping light in both space and time, we can start to see how neighboring circuits interact and how patterns of activity across the brain give rise to behavior.\"\n\"This device significantly expands what's possible in experimentally linking distributed neural activity to perception and action,\" Kepecs added. \"It brings a new level of access to probe neural circuit functions.\"\nLooking ahead, the group aims to extend PRIME into a bidirectional interface by combining optogenetics with photometry to allow researchers to stimulate and record brain activity at the same time.\n\"This is just the start of an exciting journey,\" Hu said. \"Our ultimate goal is to make PRIME wireless and wearable. The less cumbersome the tool, the more natural the data they can get from freely behaving subjects that are not bogged down in wires.\"\nMore information: Shuo Yang et al, Laser-engineered PRIME fiber for panoramic reconfigurable control of neural activity, Nature Neuroscience (2025).

Cancer cells produce high levels of hydrogen peroxide, which can damage them if it builds up. Normally, they rely on a special protein to keep this in check. The research team found a way to shut down that protein, causing toxic levels of hydrogen peroxide to overwhelm the cancer cells and destroy them, according to a study published in Science Advances.\n\"We all make hydrogen peroxide all the time, but cancer cells make more,\" said W. Todd Lowther, Ph.D., professor of biochemistry at Wake Forest University School of Medicine and the study's corresponding author. \"If we inhibit peroxiredoxin-3, the hydrogen peroxide levels go even higher and kill the cancer cells. It's kind of like pushing them off a cliff.\"\nPeroxiredoxin-3 (PRX3), which acts like a cleanup crew inside cancer cells, sits inside mitochondria and breaks down hydrogen peroxide before it becomes toxic. Tumor cells turn up PRX3 and other antioxidant defenses to handle the stress created by their altered metabolism.\nMost people think of antioxidants as protective. It turns out cancer cells do, too.\nThe research team based their work on thiostrepton, a natural product with anticancer properties. Lowther's team, which includes biochemist Kimberly J. Nelson, Ph.D., and medicinal chemist Terrence L. Smalley Jr., Ph.D., took the molecule apart, piece by piece, until they found the smallest fragment that still did the job.\nThe team discovered a tiny piece of the compound that can attach to a protein called PRX3 and switch it off. PRX3 normally helps cancer cells clean up harmful molecules. When it's turned off, those molecules, like hydrogen peroxide, build up so much that the cancer cells can't survive.\n\"Thiostrepton is a really big and bulky compound, and it's not very soluble,\" Lowther said. \"Ultimately, our goal is to be able to treat any kind of cancer, and typically, you would do that using a chemotherapy drug where you deliver it into the bloodstream through an IV infusion. But you can't do that with thiostrepton.\"\nMesothelioma, a rare and aggressive cancer often diagnosed at advanced stages, is one example where current treatment options are limited, and patients frequently face poor long-term outcomes. Thiostrepton is already being tested in mesothelioma through direct lung delivery, but its size restricts broader use. The smaller fragment represents a new opportunity to deliver a treatment intravenously and reach cancers throughout the body.\nThe smaller fragment, called WF-242, killed cancer cells as effectively as thiostrepton while avoiding many of the unwanted interactions seen with the parent molecule.\n\"The exciting part was identifying the minimal fragment and then confirming that it did not have what are called off-target effects like the intact thiostrepton molecule,\" Lowther said. \"That increases specificity and has the potential for fewer side effects.\"\nUsing cell-based studies, the team showed that WF-242 can kill cells from ovarian, lung, brain, prostate and blood cancers. Instead of lowering oxidative stress in tumors, this strategy deliberately increases it. Because cancer cells already operate near their limit for handling hydrogen peroxide, they're more vulnerable to this approach than normal cells.\n\"We've tested the compounds across many cancer types, and it appears to be working,\" Lowther said.\nTo make the new compound better, the team used a technique called X-ray crystallography to see exactly how the fragment connects to the protein that helps cancer cells survive.\n\"For me, it's always exciting to see the structure of how a drug binds to its target,\" Lowther said. \"It gives us insight into how to improve the drug.\"\nThe researchers are now refining the fragment to improve stability and solubility, work that typically takes three to five years before a candidate is ready for clinical testing.\nIf successful in clinical trials, the approach could provide treatment options for cancers that currently have limited therapies.\nMore information: Kimberly J.

These findings, published in Nature Metabolism, demonstrated that blocking this site lowered brain inflammation and protected neurons, suggesting a novel therapeutic approach for neurodegenerative disorders, including frontotemporal dementia and Alzheimer's disease.\n\"I'm really excited about the translational potential of this work,\" said Dr. Anna Orr, the Nan and Stephen Swid Associate Professor of Frontotemporal Dementia Research in the Feil Family Brain and Mind Research Institute and member of the Appel Alzheimer's Disease Research Institute at Weill Cornell, who co-led this research. \"We can now target specific mechanisms and go after the exact sites that are relevant for disease.\"\nThe researchers focused on mitochondria—metabolic structures inside cells that generate energy from food and, in the process, release molecules known as reactive oxygen species (ROS). At low levels, ROS play an important role in cell function, but they can be harmful when produced in excess or at the wrong time.\n\"Decades of research implicate mitochondrial ROS in neurodegenerative diseases,\" said Dr. Adam Orr, an assistant professor of research in neuroscience in the Feil Family Brain and Mind Research Institute at Weill Cornell, who co-led this research.\nGiven these pathological ties, some efforts to combat neurodegenerative disorders have centered on using antioxidants to mop up these chemical spills. \"But most antioxidants tested in clinical studies have failed,\" Dr. Adam Orr said. \"That lack of success might be related to the inability of antioxidants to block ROS at their source and do so selectively without altering cell metabolism.\"\nWhen he was a postdoctoral fellow, Dr. Adam Orr sought a solution to this problem. \"I developed a unique drug-discovery platform to identify molecules that precisely suppress the ROS production from singular sites in the mitochondria without disturbing other mitochondrial functions,\" he said. The researchers identified several small molecules called S3QELs (\"sequels\") that could have therapeutic potential for blocking ROS.\nTargeting the source\nThe researchers targeted Complex III, a site for oxidative metabolism that tends to push out ROS from the mitochondria into the rest of the cell, where ROS are more likely to disrupt vital cellular components.\nThey were surprised to find that the ROS did not come from the neurons' own mitochondria, but were produced by astrocytes, supportive cells cultured along with the neurons. \"When we added S3QELs, we found significant neuronal protection but only in the presence of astrocytes,\" said Daniel Barnett, a graduate student in the Orr laboratory and lead author. \"This suggested that ROS coming from Complex III caused at least some of the neuronal pathology.\"\nAdditional experiments revealed that exposing astrocytes to disease-related factors, such as neuroinflammatory molecules or proteins associated with dementia, such as amyloid-beta, boosted the cells' mitochondrial ROS production. S3QELs suppressed much of this increase, whereas blocking other potential sources of cellular ROS was not effective.\nBarnett determined the ROS oxidizes certain immune and metabolic proteins linked to neurological disease. He also found this influences the activity of thousands of genes, especially those involved in brain inflammation and associated with dementia.\nThis degree of specificity was unexpected and intriguing. \"The precision of these mechanisms had not been previously appreciated, especially not in brain cells,\" Dr. Anna Orr said. \"This suggests a very nuanced process in which specific triggers induce ROS from specific mitochondrial sites to affect specific targets.\"\nSpecificity is key\nWhen the researchers fed their S3QEL ROS inhibitor to a mouse model of frontotemporal dementia, they found it reduced astrocyte activation, blunted neuroinflammatory genes and reduced a tau modification seen in patients with dementia—even when the treatment was initiated well after the disease process had started. Prolonged treatment with S3QEL extended lifespan in the mice, was well-tolerated and produced no obvious side effects, which Dr. Anna Orr attributes to its unique specificity.\nThe team hopes to develop the compounds as a new type of therapeutic, in collaboration with medicinal chemist Dr. Subhash Sinha, professor of research in neuroscience in the Brain and Mind Research Institute and member of the Appel Alzheimer's Disease Research Institute at Weill Cornell.\nAt the same time, the researchers will continue to explore how disease-linked factors influence ROS production in the brain. They also plan to examine whether genes associated with an increased—or decreased—risk for neurodegenerative disease influence ROS generation from specific mitochondrial sites.\n\"The study has really changed our thinking about free radicals and opened up many new avenues of investigation,\" Dr. Adam Orr said.

Caring for patients with diverse health problems and complex backgrounds and making contributions to education and the community were among these experiences, which are expected to promote primary care physicians' career development. The findings are published in BMC Primary Care.\nIn a rapidly aging society with a declining birth rate, the role of primary care physicians—family physicians or general practitioners who treat patients holistically rather than focusing solely on specific organs—is becoming increasingly vital. However, the delayed formal recognition of primary care as a medical specialty in Japan has left many primary care physicians feeling uncertain regarding their professional identity, with standard role models remaining unavailable.\nHence, the researchers conducted interviews to explore the types of experiences that Japanese primary care physicians find meaningful in their work. Six key themes through which these physicians derive a sense of meaning were identified:\n- Managing diverse health problems\n- Adopting a comprehensive approach to the problems faced by patients and their families\n- Fostering rapport through continuous care\n- Collaborating with other health care professionals to provide appropriate support to patients with complex needs\n- Contributing to medical students' and health care providers' education\n- Contributing to the community and society\nTherefore, Japanese primary care physicians may find meaning in their work when they encounter experiences that promote professional growth and allow them to contribute to broader societal goals such as education and community development. Such experiences may play a crucial role in building more fulfilling and sustainable careers for these primary care physicians.\nMore information: Yu Yamamoto et al, Meaningful work experiences of certified primary care physicians in Japan: a qualitative study, BMC Primary Care (2025).

These wounds often fail to heal due to persistent inflammation, bacterial infection, and poor blood circulation. Current treatments—like dressings or topical drugs—can protect the wound but rarely restart the body's natural healing process.\nTo address this issue, researchers from National Taiwan University, led by Prof. Zong-Hong Lin, reviewed the latest advances in how physical and chemical methods can work together to heal skin injuries faster and with fewer scars. Instead of relying on a single drug or therapy, their work shows that combining multiple gentle cues—such as electricity, light, pH control, and therapeutic gases—can stimulate the skin's own repair system. The study is published in Materials Today.\nFor example, electrical stimulation can guide cell movement and tissue regrowth, while photothermal therapy uses light-induced warmth to kill bacteria and support collagen formation. In parallel, gases like nitric oxide, carbon monoxide, and hydrogen sulfide play signaling roles that regulate inflammation and promote the growth of new blood vessels. When these methods are carefully integrated, they create a healing environment that mimics the body's natural regeneration process.\nThis comprehensive approach not only offers new directions for chronic wound management but also opens possibilities for wearable smart dressings that can deliver controlled physical and chemical stimulation. These innovations could one day transform wound care from passive protection to active regeneration.\n\"By combining different healing strategies into one coordinated system, we aim to help the body heal itself more effectively and with less scarring,\" says Zong-Hong Lin, Ph.D., professor of biomedical engineering and corresponding author of the study.\nMore information: Bishal Kumar Nahak et al, Advancements in multimodal approaches for enhanced wound healing: From chemical to physical strategies, Materials Today (2025).

High-volume noise exposure produced motor deficits in a mouse model of early-stage Parkinson's disease, and established a link between the auditory processing and movement areas of the brain, according to a study published in PLOS Biology by Pei Zhang from the Huazhong University of Science and Technology in Wuhan, China, and colleagues.\nThe environment can play an important role in the development of Parkinson's disease, but how sound volume in particular might impact the severity of symptoms was unknown.\nTo understand how noise might play a role in Parkinson's symptoms, the researchers used a mouse model of early-stage Parkinson's disease, where mice do not yet show symptoms. They exposed the animals to either acute or chronic loud noise between 85 and 100 decibels—about as loud as a power mower or a blender.\nAfter just one hour of noise, mice with early-stage Parkinson's disease moved more slowly and showed reduced balance compared to control mice. The animals recovered one day later, but after receiving noise exposure for one hour per day for a week, the early-stage Parkinson's mice showed chronic movement problems.\nThe scientists also stimulated an area of the brain called the inferior colliculus, which processes sound. They showed the inferior colliculus connects to the substantia nigra pars compacta—a dopamine-producing area severely damaged in Parkinson's.\nChronically activating the inferior colliculus, they showed, mimicked the behavioral effects of noise damage in the Parkinson's mouse model.\nNoise exposure and activating the inferior colliculus both reduced a protein called VMAT 2, which transports dopamine, and killed dopamine-producing cells in the substantia nigra. Inhibiting the inferior colliculus, or expressing extra VMAT2, on the other hand, could reverse the harms of acute and chronic noise in the early-stage Parkinson's mice.\nWhile the results are in a mouse model, and other brain areas might also be involved, these results suggest there is an important connection between sound processing areas of the brain and those damaged in Parkinson's disease, and that environmental factors like noise can affect the symptoms and progression of the illness.\nThe authors add, \"Our study reveals that environmental noise exposure changes the IC-SNc circuit, leading to motor deficits and increased neuronal vulnerability in a Parkinson's disease mouse model.

This is a gel-like layer of complex sugar molecules on the outer surface of a cell membrane. The glycocalyx has many roles, including providing protection for the blood vessel wall from mechanical and chemical damage. More recently, the glycocalyx has been identified as playing a role in controlling how immune cells move through our body.\nResearchers identified that immune cells, which have their own cell surface glycocalyx, shed this layer to help them move from the blood and into tissues in inflammatory skin disease, changing the previous understanding that it was only the blood vessel wall that altered its glycocalyx layer to aid this process.\nThis glycocalyx shedding is an important response to inflammation, as it promotes immune cell movement from the blood into tissues, which is a crucial process in fighting infections. Immune cell recruitment can also be harmful, for example, driving inflammatory diseases such as psoriasis, which affects the skin.\nDr. Saunders said, \"It is really exciting to discover how important the glycocalyx layer is on immune cells, and I hope that this research will help to lay the foundations for future advances in inflammatory disease treatment.\"\nDr. Dyer said, \"It has been a pleasure working collaboratively on this project to redefine our understanding of immune cell recruitment to try and better treat inflammatory disease.\"\nDr. Priestley said, \"This was a really fun project to work on in my Ph.D., and I hope this research brings more attention to the importance of sugars in the immune system.\"\nOther members of the team included Dr. Max Nobis at the University of Manchester (previously VIB-KU Leuven), and Professor Olga Zubkova of the Victoria University of Wellington in New Zealand.\nDesigning drugs to alter the movement of immune cells between the blood and tissues is a potential way to treat both infections and inflammatory diseases.

To effectively target interventions and track progress toward international goals, accurately estimating how the AMR burden will change over time is necessary.\nIn the new study, researchers analyzed data from more than 12 million routine blood tests for bacterial infection susceptibility in 29 European countries between 2010 and 2019.\nThey used these data to generate incidence rates of these infections and predict how rates of drug-resistant bloodstream infections may change through 2050, accounting for projected population changes.\nThe researchers found that bloodstream infection rates are predicted to increase, with varying burdens by country and by bacteria-antibiotic combination. Rates are expected to rise more in men than women across six of the eight bacteria studied, and are projected to increase more dramatically in older age groups (74+ years) while stabilizing or declining in younger populations.\nModels that don't account for age and sex may miss a large part of the future burden, especially among men and older adults, the authors note. Even with strong public health interventions, achieving a 10% reduction in resistant infections by 2030 (aligned with UN targets) was only possible for about two-thirds of bacteria-antibiotic combinations, the study concluded.\nKnight adds, \"Our study shows that the future burden of drug-resistant infections won't be uniform—there will be substantial differences between countries, as well as across age groups and between sexes. We see the steepest increases in incidence projected in older age groups, particularly the over 65s, meaning that simply preventing further rises in resistant bloodstream infections would already be a major public health achievement.\"\n\"What I found most interesting was bringing together different strands of data to show the bigger picture.

Mucus plugging (mucus that accumulates in the lungs and reduces airflow) and chronic bronchitis are both related to dysfunctional airway mucus, which is common in people with COPD. Sometimes mucus plugging and chronic bronchitis co-occur, but it is quite common to have one or the other but not both conditions. Given the limited availability of disease-modifying treatments for COPD, understanding the underlying biology of mucus pathology is critical to identifying new therapeutic targets.\nIn a new study, researchers at Boston University Chobanian & Avedisian School of Medicine have found that mucus plugs in the lungs alter the pattern of gene activity in a way that is similar to chronic bronchitis, suggesting that there may be similar underlying causes to both conditions. It is believed these researchers are the first group to study gene activity differences associated with mucus plugging. The findings are published in the American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine.\n\"Mucus plugs are quite common in people with COPD and they are associated with diminished quality of life and increased mortality. By identifying how the presence of mucus plugs impacts the biology of the lung we hope to be able to better treat them, or prevent them from forming in the first place,\" says corresponding author Marc Lenburg, Ph.D., professor of medicine at the school.\nThe researchers studied participants in the Detection of Early Lung Cancer Among Military Personnel (DECAMP) 2 study who were mostly older U.S. military veterans at high risk for lung cancer due to a history of heavy smoking, many of whom had COPD. Computed tomography was performed on them to determine who had mucus plugs and for those that had them, how extensive they were.\nFrom that group, a pulmonologist collected cells from their airways and sequenced the RNA from those cells to determine the level of gene activity. The researchers then compared the gene activity from each individual with the extent of mucus plugging to find genes that had increased (or decreased) activity in individuals with more extensive mucus plugging. Once they had this mucus plugging \"gene signature,\" they compared it with gene signatures from other diseases.\nAccording to the researchers, having a better understanding of how mucus plugging impacts the lung and its relationship to chronic bronchitis may give new clues about how mucus dysfunction develops, which could be helpful for developing new therapies to better treat mucus dysfunction.\n\"By uncovering the molecular pathways that drive mucus plugging and chronic bronchitis, we aim to identify biological targets for earlier diagnosis and intervention.

Marcello talked to Rutgers Today about the condition and what you can do to help yourself feel better.\nWhat is SAD and what are some common symptoms?\nWhen daylight decreases and the temperature drops, some people may experience symptoms that go beyond the common \"winter blues\" and resemble more of a seasonal depression.\nSeasonal affective disorder (SAD) is a type of depression that follows a seasonal pattern, most commonly occurring in the winter, though some people experience it in the summer, known as summer seasonal affective disorder (SSAD). It is a type of depression that occurs seasonally, typically the winter months, and subsides during the rest of the year.\nSymptoms of SAD are the same as those seen in depression, varying in severity and intensity. Some symptoms include fatigue, feeling sad most of the day for most days, trouble with sleep including excessive sleeping, eating too much or too little, weight gain or loss, feeling hopeless, losing interest in friends and activities the person typically enjoyed.\nThese symptoms can interfere with personal relationships and, for some, be quite disabling. Sometimes people can experience thoughts of suicide. An individual might notice they feel very different than how they feel in other seasons. Professionals differentiate between depression and SAD by evaluating if you have remission of these symptoms in the spring and summer months. If you have had these symptoms for more than two winters, you might want to be evaluated for SAD.\nCould spending more time outdoors during the day help reduce the symptoms of SAD?\nLack of sun exposure is part of what causes SAD, so getting as much sunlight as possible may lessen symptoms. Whenever possible, try to get outside during daylight hours and expose yourself to sun. Sunlight, even in small doses, can help boost serotonin and improve your mood. Taking a short walk or even sitting near natural sunlight in your home and workplace can be helpful.\nThere are products on the market, like bright light therapy, that claim to alleviate SAD symptoms. Are these worth the money?\nBright light therapy (LT) has a long history of supportive research. Light therapy works through alterations in the circadian rhythms. These bright lights stimulate cells in the retina that connect to the hypothalamus, a part of the brain that helps control circadian rhythms. Some research shows it being effective for up to 85% of individuals. We recommend starting light therapy in the fall before the onset of the symptoms.\nCognitive behavioral therapy for SAD has received support in the literature also and includes behavioral activation aimed at decreasing avoidance and increasing engagement in pleasurable activities during the winter and therapy aimed at restructuring depressive thoughts.\nWhat are simple ways to fight the effects of SAD?\nGet outside, reach out to friends and family, join a support group, eat the right diet (symptoms can make you crave sugary food and simple carbohydrates), eat foods rich in omega-3 fats, learn relaxation techniques, do things you love and enjoy, even when you don't feel like it. It is very important to talk to friends and family if you are experiencing any of these symptoms and seek professional help when needed.\nBesides light therapy what are some other ways to motivate ourselves or trick the brain into overcoming these symptoms?\nAntidepressants, particularly SSRI's, can be helpful in reducing symptoms, but it's important to talk to your doctor to determine if they are right for you. Engaging in enjoyable or meaningful activities, even when energy is low, can \"trick\" the brain into releasing mood-boosting chemicals like dopamine and serotonin.\nMind-body practices such as yoga, mindfulness, and meditation also reduce stress and improve emotional balance. Getting outside, staying active, maintaining good sleep, and eating nutrient-rich foods can also help regulate mood. Please don't suffer in silence, reach out for help. SAD has very effective treatments available.", "summary": "(summarizer_error: 401 Client Error: Unauthorized for url: https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions)"}

Over the last few years, they have gone from being utilitarian devices that sweep your floor to full-fledged home robots that can vacuum and mop your home and then trundle off to clean themselves to be ready for the next run.\nThe best robot vacuums we’ve tested for 2025\nWe picked the best bots you can buy right now.\nWe picked the best bots you can buy right now.\nI’ve been testing robot vacuums for seven years and have run over 70 robot vacuums all over my house. These are my top picks if you’re looking for the best: a robot vacuum that can do it all with limited intervention from you.\nAlong with my top picks, I have options to fit specific needs, such as mopping or besting pet hair. The good news is that there are a lot of great options. Whether you have a 3,000-square-foot home and three shaggy dogs or a small, stylish apartment you share with a goldfish, there’s a robot vacuum to suit your needs.\nFeatured Products\nWhat I look for\nI test robot vacuums constantly. At any time, there are seven or eight of these busy little bots roaming my floors. Alongside everyday use, I put them through a gauntlet of specific tests. This includes testing object detection and avoidance with phone chargers, socks, a pencil, and fake pet poop. I throw in Cheerios or popcorn to see if they know to vacuum that up rather than avoid it. I also run them over oatmeal and flour to see how well they pick up fine debris and have them tackle both thick and low-pile carpets. I watch to see how they handle rug tassels, skinny chair legs, and room transitions.For mopping prowess, I test them on hardwood and tile floors with dried milk, fresh OJ, and ketchup. I monitor how quickly they fill up their bin / auto-empty dock and how efficiently they use water and clean their mop pads.I also set schedules, hook them up to voice assistants, and play with any advanced features in the app. I evaluate how well they map and how easy the maps are to edit and use, as well as test and unique features such as home security camera capabilities, AI cleaning programs, and auto-mop removal.\nIt’s not all about suction. In my testing, the brush is also a big factor in how well a robot will clean your floors. A large rubber roller brush is much better than a small bristle brush at picking up debris. It’s also less prone to getting tangled up with hair. Two brushes are better than one, and a brush housing that has some flexibility — so it can move with the contours of the floor — is also more effective.It’s hard to find a robot vac that doesn’t have some form of mopping, but not all mops are created equal. I looked for mopping bots that could get up dried-on stains, like milk and ketchup, and scrub up small wet spills without messing themselves up. Oscillating, spinning, or vibrating mop pads clean better than bots that just drag a wet rag around, but the new self-cleaning roller mops that are beginning to appear are even more effective. Auto-carpet sensing is also important since it prevents the robot from accidentally mopping your rug.\nA big bin means you don’t need to empty it as often. The largest I’ve seen is 800ml, but anything over 500ml is decent. With many bots now pulling double duty as mopping robots, plus the popularity of self-empty dock / charging bases, it’s getting harder to find small robot vacs with big bins. But they’re worth considering — especially if you have carpets and pets. I love self-empty docks, but sometimes you don’t have space for them, and if you like your robot to be out of sight (living under your bed or sofa), you’ll want a big bin and no dock.Self-emptying docks are becoming standard now and coming down in price (thankfully). A self-empty dock turns the charging base for your robot into a motorized emptying station that sucks out the dirt from its bin. (Warning: this process can be loud!) This saves you from having to pull out the bin after every few runs and empty it yourself. Instead, you’ll have to replace the bag (and buy new ones) when it gets full, generally about once a month. Many robots now have a self-empty dock option you can add later, although buying them together is generally cheaper.\nAnother nice-to-have feature, AI-powered obstacle detection helps your robot “intelligently” detect and avoid clutter (and a potential poop apocalypse if it encounters pet waste). These models use cameras (worth noting) to see objects in their path and onboard processors to “decide” how to approach them based on what they see. All AI is not created equal, however, and some are much better at this than others. The end result is that robot vacuums with AI detection are less likely to get stuck when cleaning, so you’re more likely to come home to a clean floor rather than a beached bot.A robot that maps your house will get into every nook and cranny better than one that bumps and rolls around. Mapping also lets you send the robot to clean specific rooms rather than the whole space and add virtual walls to prevent your bot from going where you don’t want it to. These are crucial if you have delicate objects or areas in your home that regularly trap robots. Most robots use variations on simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) technology, such as lidar or vSLAM.\nA good app has easy controls to stop and start your vacuum, scheduling options (including do-not disturb hours), plus good mapping features. Nice-to-have features are room-specific cleaning and settings (so you can tell your vacuum to clean the kitchen or have it mop and vacuum the kitchen but only vacuum the living room). My biggest frustration with apps is maps that are fiddly to update and / or crash and must be rebuilt constantly. Most vacuums now have voice control (see FAQs), but some offer more in-depth control, such as telling Alexa to have the robot clean twice under the dining room table.\nNearly all robot vacuums can “recharge and resume” — take themselves back to their dock when they’re low and recharge before picking up where they left off. But a vacuum with at least 120 minutes of runtime (180 is ideal) will clean the whole house in one go. If it takes too long, noisy robots that are constantly running will get shut off by annoyed family members who aren’t about to clean the room for you.Robot vacuums are quite an investment, and it’s important to be able to buy replacement parts to keep them going for longer and have access to good support in case your robot has a serious issue.\nBest robot vacuum\nRoborock S8 MaxV Ultra\nThe Good\n- Excellent vacuuming performance\n- Good sonic mopping\n- Extendable side brush gets into corners better\n- Very good app\nThe Bad\n- Dock is still quite ugly\n- Mopping tray is hard to clean\n- Expensive\nDustbin capacity: 270ml / Self-empty dock option: Yes / Auto-refill mop option: Yes / Mop lift: Yes, 20mm / Mop washing: Hot water and heated air drying / Mapping: Yes, lidar / AI-powered obstacle detection: Yes / Suction power: 10,000Pa / Remote check-in: Yes / Keep-out zones: Yes, virtual / Brush style: Dual rubber / Works with: Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Siri Shortcuts, Apple Home via Matter\nRoborock’s S8 MaxV Ultra ($1,799.99) is an exceptional vacuum cleaner and a very good mop. Its dual rubber roller brushes and 10,000Pa suction make it great on carpets; its sonic mopping is very good on hard floors, and its improved AI-powered obstacle detection means it will most likely get the job done without getting trapped or derailed.\nThe S8 MaxV Ultra is the best in the category of “hands-free” robot vacs, bots that do virtually everything for you: empty their bins, refill their mop tanks, and clean and dry their mop pads. Roborock invented this category with the S7 MaxV Ultra and has been steadily improving it.\nThat’s the big selling point here; this bot is basically hands-free. Fill the S8 MaxV Ultra’s clean water tank and empty its dirty water once a week and change out the dust bag every couple of months. The robot will take care of the rest.\nFor $100 more, you can dispense with dealing with the water tanks entirely and buy the Refill & Drainage System model. This lets you plumb the charging base directly into your home’s water supply. I’ve not tested this on the Roborock, but my experience with the SwitchBot S10 with the same feature leads me to recommend this option if you can swing it.\nThe S8 MaxV Ultra comes with excellent AI-powered obstacle detection, bringing back the camera it last had on the S7 MaxV Ultra. It’s not quite as good as Roomba’s obstacle detection — it sometimes confused a pile of Cheerios for a charging cable and avoided them — but it’s much better than the Roborocks that rely on non-camera obstacle detection. It deftly navigates around most household clutter, allowing you to get the job done without having to tidy up.\nRoborock has caught up to Roomba on cleaning prowess, and the S8 MaxV Ultra’s dual rubber brushes and 10,000Pa of suction power tackled the pet hair on my fluffy carpet and demolished my oatmeal test.\nIt also did a better job at mopping than Roomba’s mopping bots, though not quite as well as the Narwal Freo X Ultra or Dreame X40 Ultra, though it’s a better vacuum than either.\nIts sonic mopping system — which vibrates its mop pad 4,000 times a minute — ably simulated scrubbing and wiped out my OJ and ketchup tests, though I did have to set it to deep scrub. Plus, the addition of a side mop and flexi-arm brush that extends from the bot helped with cleaning edges and corners.\nRoborock’s mobile app is easy to use and comes with a laundry list of features and customizations that give you ample control over your cleaning. The S8 MaxV Ultra also has a built-in voice assistant, which makes getting the bot to clean the mess your kid made after dinner as easy as saying, “Rocky, clean here.”\nRoborock also sells the S8 Max Ultra (no V) for $1,599.99. It has the same cleaning hardware as the MaxV but no camera, so its obstacle detection will not be as good. However, you also don’t have to worry about a camera in your house. It has a lower 8,000Pa of suction and lacks a voice assistant, too, which makes it seem overpriced since it’s currently only a couple hundred dollars less than the MaxV.\nThere are several great vacuum / mop hybrids in this guide. Of them, the S8 MaxV Ultra is the best at vacuuming and obstacle detection, and it’s a very good mop. It can also do both in one run, as it can lift its mop 20mm, which will clear all but the highest-pile rugs. If you have a lot of those, go for the Dreame X40, with its automatic mop removal. Its vacuuming and object detection are a notch below the Roborock’s, but its mopping is a notch above. The Narwal Freo X Ultra is an even better mop than the Dreame, but its obstacle detection isn’t great, and its vacuuming is merely pretty good.\nBest budget robot vacuum\nTapo RV30 Max Plus\nThe Good\n- Cheap, even with the auto-empty dock\n- A dual mop and dustbin means no swapping\n- Room-specific cleaning\n- Carpet boost\nThe Bad\n- Short battery life\n- Slow to recharge\n- Docking can be spotty\n- Basic obstacle detection\nDustbin capacity: 300ml / Self-empty dock option: Yes / Auto-refill mop option: No / Mop lift: No / Mop washing: No / Mapping: Yes, lidar / AI-powered obstacle detection: No / Suction power: 5,300Pa / Remote check-in: No / Keep-out zones: Yes, virtual / Brush style: Single rubber bristle hybrid / Works with: Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Siri Shortcuts\nFor around $300, the Tapo RV30 Max Plus is a very capable robot vacuum and mop with some key features usually only found on vacuums that are more than twice its price. These include room-specific cleaning, multiple suction and water levels, smart lidar-based navigation, and an auto-empty dock. With brands like Roomba and Roborock, you’re often paying double for the privilege of not having to empty the bot’s bin.\nThanks to lidar navigation, the RV30 did an excellent job of navigating my house, cleaning the perimeters of the rooms, and then using a mesh grid to clean inside the rooms. I did have to tidy up before it ran, though, as there’s no camera on board or AI-powered obstacle detection — so cables and socks will trip it up.\nIts 5,200Pa suction power is impressive on a bot at this price, and ably sucked up Cheerios and dry oatmeal on hard flooring. It left some of the finer dust and debris, as its single bristle / rubber brush isn’t super effective. It fared less well on carpet. However, in the app, I could set it to clean a room three times for each job, after which it had generally picked up all visible debris.\nMopping was better than average for a mop with no pressure or oscillation. It has a wide mop pad, and the bot has a big 300ml tank (which also incorporates a 300ml dustbin), so it applies enough water to do a good surface clean.\nAnother unique feature for a budget robot is the ability to set customized cleaning for each room, choosing from five suction levels and three water levels as well as the three rotations.\n5,200Pa suction power is impressive on a bot at this price\nThe Tapo app is very simple to use, with an easy-to-edit map that lets you add virtual walls and no-go zones, add furniture, and designate carpet areas. There’s no carpet sensing, so you need to tell it where carpets are if you don’t want it to mop them. You can even set the cleaning direction and build up to four maps — again, features usually only found on higher-end robots.\nIt’s also super easy to start a clean, and I really like that you can just tap on the map to send the robot to that spot. The biggest downside of the Tapo is its tiny battery, which is just 2,600mAh. That is half the size of most vacs, and it couldn’t clean my entire 800-square-foot downstairs without needing to go back and recharge. It also takes a while to charge and occasionally had trouble repositioning itself on its dock. You can get the RV30 without the auto-empty dock for around $80 less if you prefer an even simpler robot vacuum setup. This way, it will fit under a couch or bed, but you’ll have to manually empty its bin.\nBest mopping robot vacuum for hard floors\nNarwal Freo X Ultra\nThe Good\n- The best mopping robot\n- Also good at vacuuming\n- Very quiet\n- Big water tanks mean less refilling\nThe Bad\n- Middling laser-based obstacle avoidance\n- Wonky app\n- Huge charging dock\nDustbin capacity: 1L / Self-empty dock option: No / Auto-refill mop option: Yes / Mop lift: Yes, 12mm / Mop washing: Yes, hot air drying / Mapping: Yes, lidar / AI-powered obstacle detection: Yes / Suction power: 8,200Pa / Remote check-in: No / Keep-out zones: Yes, virtual / Brush style: Single, conical rubber bristle hybrid / Works with: Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Siri Shortcuts\nThe Narwal Freo X Ultra is one of the best mopping robots I’ve tested — and it’s a good vacuum, too. Its spinning triangular mop pads rotate at 180RPM with 12n of downward pressure. Combined with its ability to swing slightly to get closer to baseboards, the Narwal does a very good job on hard floors. Its dual four-liter water tanks will keep you going longer than most other mopping bots as well, the majority of which feature smaller tanks.\nThe Narwal has some innovative features, including dirt sense — which analyzes the dirt level in the water and prompts it to remop — and an ability to adapt the pressure of its mop based on the type of floor, applying more pressure to tile and less to hardwood. “Freo” refers to the bot’s ability to make cleaning “decisions,” including going back to clean dirty floors.\nIts charging dock is very big, though, giving off a real Wall-E vibe. But despite the size, there’s no spot for an auto-empty dustbin; instead, Narwal’s disposable onboard bin compresses the dust, and Narwal claims you won’t need to empty it for up to 60 days. It wasn’t close to full after two weeks of testing. A bonus here is that there’s no loud noise, as is the case with most auto-empty docks.\nIts charging dock is very big, giving off a real Wall-E vibe\nIn fact, the Freo X Ultra is one of the quietest bots I’ve tested. Even at full power, it was so quiet that I had to check that it was working. Its anti-tangle brush and 8,200Pa suction did a good job on most carpet, but its 12mm mop lifting isn’t good for plush carpets.\nNarwal’s obstacle detection is also only okay; there’s no camera, and it routinely eats cables. Its three lasers can identify objects as small as a sock and move around them, and it did pass my fake pet poop test.\nThe app is very hard to follow, making it tricky to access all of the bot’s features. Mapping was fast, but it didn’t recognize all my rooms on the first go. It did better the second time, although splitting up rooms and naming them in the app was painful. The lack of a camera also means its navigation is spotty, and sending it to clean specific rooms wasn’t always successful. But if you’ve got a lot of hard floors to keep clean, it will do an excellent job.\nBest robot vacuum / mop hybrid\nDreame X40 Ultra\nThe Good\n- Self-removing mop pads\n- Mop extension reaches under edges\n- Self-cleaning washboard\n- Dirt detection tech\nThe Bad\n- Middling AI obstacle detection\n- Single rubber roller brush\n- App can be flaky\nDustbin capacity: 300ml / Self-empty dock option: Yes / Auto-refill mop option: Yes / Mop-lift: Yes, 20mm / Mop washing: Hot water, hot air drying / Mapping: Yes, lidar / AI-powered obstacle detection: Yes / Suction power: 12,000Pa / Remote check-in: Yes / Keep-out zones: Yes, virtual / Brush style: Single, rubber / Works with: Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Siri Shortcuts\nThe Dreame X40 is the best robot vacuum / mop hybrid because it can drop its mop pads automatically, extend them, and swing them to get under your cabinets and consoles. I watched the X40 spread its mops wide apart and swing behind my TV console, allowing it to access the dust wedged a good inch under it. That’s impressive.\nThe X40 also features an extending side brush arm to reach corners — like the Roborock S8 MaxV Ultra — and its dual oscillating mop pads are more effective than Roborock’s thin microfiber pad. If you have a mix of carpeted rooms and hardwood floors with high-pile rugs, the Dreame is the best robot vacuum for you.\nIts signature feature is its ability to automatically remove and reattach its mop pads, depending on whether it’s vacuuming or mopping. This solves the problem of how to vacuum and mop without getting your rugs wet. The robot will do this procedure multiple times during cleaning to ensure carpets are vacuumed and floors are mopped. Genius.\nWhile it’s a superb mopper, its vacuuming prowess is slightly behind the Roborock S8 MaxV Ultra because, despite its 12,000Pa suction power, it still only has a single roller rubber brush. The Roborock’s dual rollers are simply better at getting dirt out of carpets and tackling pet hair.\nIf you have a mix of carpeted rooms and hardwood floors with high-pile rugs, the Dreame is the best robot vacuum for you\nRoborock’s app is also more stable and easier to use than Dreame’s, which often crashes and can take a while to load. While the Roborock S8 MaxV Ultra is my top pick overall, the Dreame X40 is a very good vacuum, and the two companies are neck and neck regarding innovative features.\nThe X40 can also clean its washboard, something the Roborock can’t. That area can get quite grungy, so it needs a cleaning every few weeks. The X40 has AI-powered smart dirt detection that uses its cameras to identify spills like milk or particularly dirty areas. When it spots something, it will slow down and do a more thorough cleaning. I also like Dreame’s option to vacuum first and then mop, which the Roborock doesn’t offer.\nThe X40 has AI-powered obstacle detection, although Roborock’s is just a bit better. However, both still get tripped up occasionally by pencils and other small items — something that never happens with the Roombas with this feature.\nBest midrange robot vacuum / mop\nEufy X10 Pro Omni\nThe Good\n- Good AI-powered obstacle detection\n- Effective mopping\n- Excellent value\n- Nice dock\nThe Bad\n- Single rubber / bristle brush\n- Lower suction power\n- No heated mop washing\n- Some navigation issues\nDustbin capacity: Unknown / Self-empty dock option: Yes / Auto-refill mop option: Yes / Mop lift: Yes, 12mm / Mop washing: Yes, hot air drying / Mapping: Yes, lidar / AI-powered obstacle detection: Yes / Suction power: 8,000Pa / Remote check-in: No / Keep-out zones: Yes, virtual / Brush style: Single rubber / bristle hybrid / Works with: Amazon Alexa, Google Home\nThe Eufy X10 Pro Omni combines the Eufy Clean X9 Pro mopping robot vacuum and the Eufy X8 Pro self-empty robot vacuum. It’s the first Eufy with a multifunction auto-empty / wash / fill dock, and unlike many bots in this price range, it comes with AI-powered obstacle detection.\nWith 8,000Pa suction and oscillating dual spinning brushes for mopping, the X10 has all the same functions as the top-of-the-line, all-in-one bots — but it’s not quite as good at any of them. Which is sort of the definition of “midrange.”\nThe X10 has all the same functions as the top-of-the-line, all-in-one bots — but it’s not quite as good at any of them\nThe Eufy performed excellently in my mopping tests, even eradicating dried stains with its 1kg of downward pressure. Thanks to an onboard water reservoir, it didn’t have to head home to fill up as frequently as some mopping bots do. It also has heated mop drying to help prevent the base from getting stinky — a first in this price range. (There’s no hot water washing.)\nAn edge-hugging mode makes the robot swing its behind into the baseboards to help mop edges. With its square-ish shape, it got into corners better than most of the round bots. But its 12mm mop pad lift over carpet wasn’t effective, resulting in its pads getting hung up in a few places.\nThe X10 has great object recognition, allowing it to suck up Cheerios and piles of oatmeal while deftly navigating fake dog turds and cables. However, its navigation sometimes got screwy; it would go into a corner and stay there for a while, trying to figure itself out.\nWhile its vacuuming is good, particularly on carpet and tile surfaces, the single rubber / bristle roller brush lets it down and is a good illustration of my point that it’s not all about suction power; it’s also about the brushes and how you use them. The Eufy’s brush is supposedly anti-tangle — a cutting tool inside the robot should shred the hair — but this wasn’t effective.\nThe Eufy Clean app is very easy to use, and the lidar-powered mapping was fast and accurate, dividing my rooms correctly on the first try. There are many customization options — including room-specific cleaning, zone cleaning, and customized cleaning — but the app is clear and well laid out.\nBest robot vacuum for pet hair\nRoomba Combo 10 Max\nThe Good\n- Excellent vacuuming\n- Superior AI obstacle detection\n- Smart scrub feature works well\n- Attractive dock that doubles as a table\nThe Bad\n- Small mop pad\n- Limited cleaning customization\n- Mapping can take a long time\n- Navigation can be buggy\nDustbin capacity: 250 ml / Self-empty dock option: Yes / Auto-refill mop option: Yes / Mop lift: Yes, up and over / Mop washing: Yes / Mapping: Yes, vSLAM / AI-powered obstacle detection: Yes / Suction power: N/A / Remote check-in: No / Keep-out zones: Yes, virtual / Brush style: Dual rubber / Works with: Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Siri Shortcuts, Apple Home via the Matter protocol.\nWhile Roombas may have fallen behind the competition in terms of features and innovation, there’s one area in which they reign supreme, and that’s cleaning prowess. Their dual rubber roller brushes rotate in opposite directions to effectively dig up dirt from carpets, and they are by far the best at tackling pet hair on all surfaces. They are also one of the most self-repairable robot vacuums you can buy, with spare parts for most of the bot’s bits readily available.\nThe newest model, the Combo 10 Max, is the best Roomba for pet hair as it ties for the highest suction power of the current Roomba line, plus it can clean its own mop. It also has top-notch AI-powered obstacle detection that is able to tell the difference between pet poop and a pile of popcorn (and vacuum up one while avoiding the other).\nWhile its mopping isn’t great — the pad is tiny, and there’s no swinging to get along baseboards — it does a decent job, and its retractable mopping system is handy if you have a lot of carpets. All of this makes the Combo 10 Max a great buy for pet parents who are in a daily battle with shedding and occasional muddy paw prints.\nThe Combo is the first Roomba with a multifunction dock that can refill its mopping tank and self-wash its mopping pad, meaning less hands-on time for you. (The j9 Combo Plus has the same suction power and can refill its mopping tank but can’t wash the mop pad.) The SmartScrub feature that tells the robot to wiggle its butt to scrub your floors works surprisingly well, but it’s really only effective on small areas, making it good to run in hallways and around pet bowls for an extra clean.\nThe Dirt Detect feature remembers the dirtiest rooms, actively seeking out spots my hairy Wirehaired Pointing Griffon hangs out\nThe Dirt Detect feature remembers the dirtiest rooms, and I found that meant it actively seeks out the spots my hairy Wirehaired Pointing Griffon hangs out. The 10 Max can also be set to mop only, which is a new option and is handy for deep cleans. But there’s no hot water washing or hot air drying of the mop as there is on similar Dreame and Roborock models, so you’ll want to throw the pad in the washing machine every now and then.\niRobot’s app is also a bit of a pain point. While I appreciate its simplicity, I miss the deeper cleaning customization options that most other high-end robot vacuum apps offer. And it’s recently started popping up ads for Roomba products when I navigate between screens — which is one of the features I did not want to see migrate over from the competition.\nWhile its mapping is very good, it can take a really long time (Roombas use vSLAM, not lidar), and it doesn’t seem to adapt to changes in my home as easily as other robots. (It also doesn’t lose my maps as often as other robots.) I’ve also noticed that the newer Roombas (j9 and 10 Max) suffer from the occasional navigation glitches, occasionally getting confused and needing to be rebooted.\nI really like Roomba’s dock design, which, while large enough to accommodate two rather small water tanks, is the most stylish of all the multifunction docks. Plus, because you access the water tanks from the front rather than the top (as on most other models), it can be used as a table. That’s a small quality-of-life upgrade I enjoy.\nOverall, it’s a good-looking robot that vacuums really well and is smart enough to get the job done with limited intervention. If you’re not interested in mopping at all, however, save some money and get the Roomba j9 Plus. It has similar cleaning prowess, a self-empty dock, and no messing with mopping.\nOther robot vacuums to consider\n- The 360 Vis Nav ($499.99\n$999.99), Dyson’s first robovac in the US in almost a decade, is a powerful beast and the best robot vacuum for carpets I’ve tested. But its navigation needs a lot of work. If you have a simple floor plan with a lot of carpets, it is worth considering, but the short battery life and lack of an auto-empty dock are major cons. Read more in this hands-on. - The Roomba j7 ($599.99) is a previous top pick that has great AI-powered obstacle detection, excellent navigation skills, and superior cleaning power. It can be a bit rough with furniture, but it is aggressive at getting your floors clean and is a great vacuum-only Roomba.\n- The Dreame X30 Ultra ($399.99\n$899.99) is the older version of my top pick for a vacuum / mop hybrid and is a great buy if you can get it on sale. It does most everything the X40 Ultra does, just with lower suction power (8,3000Pa) and no flexi-arm. - The Roborock Q8 Max Plus ($659.99) is the bigger brother to the Q5 Pro (my pick for pet hair in my budget robot vacuum guide), adding better obstacle detection (still no camera) and better mopping. However, it has a smaller bin to make way for a much bigger water reservoir for mopping (350ml). If you like the idea of the Q5 Pro but want better mopping, this is a good option, although it’s currently only available without an auto-empty dock at Walmart for $179.99 ($20 off).\n- The Shark Matrix Plus 2-in-1 ($299.99\n$699.99) was my previous runner-up pick for a midrange option that self-empties its bin, vacuums, and mops. It mops very well, but you have to manually fill and attach the mop reservoir and empty the bin.\nWhat I’m testing and what’s coming next\n- The Matic is a $1,095 robot vacuum that doesn’t require a cloud connection and utilizes cameras for navigation. It’s also the first robovac / mop I’ve seen that can suck up both wet and dry spills. It’s easily the smartest machine I’ve tested, one that can mimic human cleaning with impressive precision and excellent mapping and navigation abilities. It’s also easy to operate and maintain, and it’s proven to be remarkably reliable. We’ll be publishing our full review soon, so stay tuned. In the meantime, here’s some video of it in action.\n- DJI’s new Romo robot vacuum / mop comes in three configurations, with the flagship model being the transparent Romo P, which retails for €1,899 (around $2,200). Then there’s the Romo A, which is partially transparent and costs €1,599 (around $1,700), and the white Romo S, which is the most affordable at €1,299 (around $1,500). All three use wide-angle dual-transmitter solid-state lidar — the same tech found in DJI’s flagship drones — along with a pair of fish-eye vision sensors, which allow them to spot objects as thin as a playing card. All three models offer built-in sound suppression and hot air for drying mop pads, although the auto-empty base for the high-end Romo P also features a slot for dispensing a “floor deodorizer solution.” At the moment, all three robovacs are only available in Europe.\n- Roborock’s Saros 10 ($1,599.99) and 10R ($1,599.99) are upgrades to the S8 MaxV Ultra. Both can automatically remove their mop pads when not needed — a new option for Roborock — and feature an AdaptLift chassis to climb high room transitions. The 10R features 19,000Pa suction power, StarSight 2.0 navigation, and oscillating mops. The Saros 10 has 22,000Pa of suction power, lidar navigation, and the vibrating flat mopping pad of the S8 MaxV.\n- Roborock also recently released the Saros Z70 ($1,999.99,\n$2,599), which is the first mass-produced robovac to feature a robotic arm that can pick up objects like socks and tissues. The arm itself isn’t particularly reliable, but the Z70 still functions as an excellent robot vacuum with 22,000Pa suction power, support for Roborock’s StarSight navigation system, and an AdaptLift chassis. Read our review. - In March, iRobot announced a new Roomba lineup that starts at $299 and goes up to $999. All of the robovacs come with lidar navigation and mapping, 7,000Pa suction power, and four suction levels. The pricier 405 and 505 models are the first Roombas to feature dual spinning mopping pads, while the 505 also offers heated mop drying, which is something even the higher-end Combo 10 Max lacks.\n- In April, iRobot also introduced the Roomba Max 705 ($549.99\n$899.99), which comes with an auto-empty dock. The Matter-compatible robovac brings back iRobot’s dual rubber roller brushes, which, based on our previous testing, do an excellent job of picking up pet hair; the 705 also features AI-powered obstacle detection, lidar navigation, and 13,000Pa of suction — the most of any Roomba to date. - iRobot recently released the Roomba Max 705 Combo ($1,299.99), an upgraded version of the Roomba Max 705. The step-up model comes with a new self-deploying mop cover to protect carpets from getting wet, along with an extendable mop that cleans corners and wall edges for a more thorough clean.\n- The new Eufy Robot Vacuum Omni E28 ($749.99 with code WS24T2352111\n$1,399.99) is a self-emptying, self-refilling, and self-washing robot vacuum / mop hybrid. The vac comes with a deep cleaner integrated into the charging dock, which you can use to spray clean water on stains before sucking everything into a separate wastewater tank. It’s also powerful, boasting up to 20,000Pa of suction power, and offers AI-powered obstacle detection and Matter support. - The Dreame X50 Ultra ($1,049.99\n$1,699.99) adds a “motorized swing arm” that acts like a leg, allowing the robovac to climb a transition up to 6cm tall. Otherwise, it’s a lot like the X40 Ultra, only with higher suction power. - The Ecovacs Deebot X8 Pro Omni ($839.99\n$1,399.99) is the first Deebot with a roller mop. It features an extendable mop that can clean itself, boasts 18,000Pa of suction power, and comes with a redesigned auto-empty fill dock. - The Switchbot K10 Plus Pro Combo ($397.09 at checkout\n$417.99) is an upgrade to the compact K10 Plus, a previous pick for the best robot vacuum for small spaces. It has better obstacle detection and a bump up to 3,000Pa of suction power. Plus, its auto-empty dock incorporates a manual stick vacuum. - The Switchbot S20 robot vacuum / mop hybrid ($480 with code BXBX40\n$799.99), which looks like the Switchbot S20 Pro announced at CES, launched in early August. It features an extendable roller mop and side brush, as well as 15,000Pa of suction power, which is more than twice that of our previous pick for the best mopping vacuum (the last-gen S10). - SharkNinja’s PowerDetect NeverTouch Pro 2-in-1 robot vacuum / mop ($599.99\n$999.99) can lift itself over rugs by up to 20mm. Uniquely, its automatic empty /wash / dry cleaning station doesn’t require bags. - Roborock’s Qrevo Curv ($999.99 $\n1,599.99) can raise itself to clear thresholds up to 40mm. The svelte-looking bot gets its name from a curved FlexiArm Arc side brush, which helps prevent hair from tangling as much. - Narwal’s Freo Z Ultra ($949.99 with code FRZU\n$1,499.99) is an upgrade to my current pick for the best mopping bot. It features dual cameras and dual AI chips for seeing and identifying objects, which should help with obstacle detection and vacuuming methods. - The Eufy S1 Pro ($799.99 $\n1,499.99) has a long roller mop that self-cleans as it mops and features a square-ish design that allows it to get into corners more easily. A single rubber roller brush, 8,000Pa of suction, and 3D-powered obstacle detection tackle the vacuuming.\nRobot vacuum FAQ\nSuction power is measured in pascals (Pa), and while most vacuums offer between 5,000 and 8,000, we’re starting to see robots with 18,000 and even 22,000Pa. Higher suction power will do a better job getting the fine dust and debris off your floor, but it’s important that it’s paired with effective brushes. The real key to a clean floor with a robot vac is consistency. Run it daily if you can; it won’t keep up as well if it only runs once a week. If you want hands-free cleaning everywhere, you’ll want to budget for one per floor or be prepared to move it around. You can also buy extra charging bases, and most models can map multiple floors.\nYes, every Wi-Fi-connected robot vacuum worth its salt today works with Alexa or Google smart speakers for voice control. However, some are limited to stop, start, pause, and maybe suction level, whereas others can be told to go clean specific areas. Here’s how to set up a bot with Alexa voice control or Google Home voice control. A couple of manufacturers now also work with Siri Shortcuts, so you can use Apple’s Siri voice assistant to command your bot. Robot vacuums are now part of Matter, meaning more opportunities for smart home integration and native Siri voice control for robot vacuums.\nMatter is a new smart home standard that allows connected gadgets to work with any smart home platform, including Apple Home, Amazon Alexa, Google Home, and Samsung SmartThings. When connected to your smart home platform through Matter, you should be able to control basic robot actions including start / stop and changing cleaning modes, as well as get alerts directly in the app, meaning you won’t need to use the manufacturer’s app for these functions.Matter 1.4 added support for cleaning specific areas, so while you will still need the manufacturer app to set up a map, you will be able to use your smart home platform app and / or voice assistant to direct the robot to do things like clean the kitchen or clean downstairs. Samsung SmartThings and Amazon both support robot vacuums in Matter; Apple added it to iOS 18.4, and Google said support is coming soon.While Amazon Alexa and Google Home have supported robot vacuums for years via the cloud, Matter will bring this control locally. It will also bring support to Apple Home for the first time, allowing you to control them with Siri through HomePods and add them to scenes and automation.There are still relatively few robot vacuums that support Matter.

It’s a ‘moonshot’ research project Google announced today called Project Suncatcher.\nGoogle has a ‘moonshot’ plan for AI data centers in space\nIt’s trying to figure out how to turn constellations of solar-powered satellites into data centers.\nIt’s trying to figure out how to turn constellations of solar-powered satellites into data centers.\nIf it can ever get off the ground, the project would essentially create space-based data centers. Google hopes that by doing so, it can harness solar power around-the-clock. The dream is harnessing a near-unlimited source of clean energy that might allow the company to chase its AI ambitions without the concerns its data centers on Earth have raised when it comes to driving up power plant emissions and utility bills through soaring electricity demand.\n“In the future, space may be the best place to scale AI compute,” Travis Beals, a Google senior director for Paradigms of Intelligence, writes in a blog post today. The company also published a preprint paper, which has not undergone academic peer review, detailing its progress so far on this endeavor.\n“In the future, space may be the best place to scale AI compute.”\nThere are major hurdles Google would need to overcome to turn this plan into reality, which it explains in the blog and paper. Google envisions its Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) orbiting Earth on satellites outfitted with solar panels that could generate electricity almost continuously, making them eight times more productive than similar panels on Earth, according to Google.\nA major challenge will be to ensure that the satellites can communicate well with each other. Competing with data centers on land “requires links between satellites that support tens of terabits per second,” Google writes. Maneuvering constellations of satellites into tight formations can help them achieve that, perhaps flying satellites within “kilometers or less” of each other. That’s much closer than satellites operate today, and already space junk from collisions is a growing risk.\nOn top of that, Google has to ensure that its TPUs can withstand higher levels of radiation in space. It has tested its Trillium TPUs for radiation tolerance and says they “survive a total ionizing dose equivalent to a 5 year mission life without permanent failures.”\nIt would be pretty pricey to send those TPUs into space at the moment. But a cost analysis the company performed suggests that launching and running a data center in space could become “roughly comparable” to the energy costs of an equivalent data center on Earth on a per-kilowatt/year basis by the mid-2030s. Google says it’s planning a joint mission with the company Planet to launch a couple prototype satellites by 2027 in order to test its hardware in orbit.\nMost Popular\n- iOS 26.1 lets you tweak Liquid Glass, and it’s out now\n- Coca-Cola’s new AI holiday ad is a sloppy eyesore\n- Making KPop Demon Hunters sound magical meant finding the right harmonies\n- Apple TV’s new name now comes with a new sound\n- Google’s TV Streamer (4K) is down to its best price to date ahead of Black Friday", "summary": "(summarizer_error: 401 Client Error: Unauthorized for url: https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions)"}

That’s why we’ve made the process easier by providing the best deals on great TVs.\nRight now, there are a number of discounted 4K TVs to choose from, spanning a wide variety of prices, sizes, and feature sets. Whether you want a secondary screen for the bedroom or a high-end OLED that’s built to provide the ultimate gaming or cinematic experience, we’ve picked out the best TV deals.\nFeatured Products\nThe best 4K TV deals for most people\nSamsung Q8F\nSamsung’s Q8F is available for around $597.99 ($152 off) at Amazon, Best Buy, and B&H Photo in its 55-inch configuration, which is a solid value for a QLED 4K TV. Its quantum dot LED panel boasts great contrast (especially in HDR content). The Q8F has a 120Hz panel and four HDMI 2.0 ports. This means you can play in 4K at up to 60Hz with a Nintendo Switch 2, Xbox Series S/X, or a PlayStation 5 Pro, or at a faster 120Hz refresh rate bumped down to 1440p resolution. Samsung is also including two free months of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate with purchase, which will allow you to stream games directly to your TV through the cloud, eliminating the need for a console.\nThe TV is powered by Samsung’s Q4 AI processor, which is used to upscale HD video to 4K when necessary, to optimize the picture in real-time, and make navigating its interface feel snappy. Samsung also touts the Q8F’s audio system, which adjusts the EQ and boost dialogue volume when needed. If you’ve cut the cord with cable, you can watch over 2,700 free channels of TV (over 400 of which are exclusive to Samsung TVs) in addition to streaming services. You can save $402 by jumping up to the 85-inch model, which is on sale for around $1,597.99 at Amazon, Best Buy, and B&H Photo.\nIf you’re looking for a 65-inch TV for watching sports, TV shows, movies, or playing video games, Hisense’s U65QF is a great choice, one you can currently purchase at Amazon and Best Buy for $587.99 ($412 off). The TV features a native 144Hz refresh rate and two HDMI 2.1 ports, both of which can take full advantage of the high-speed display. It also sports a pair of HDMI 2.0 ports — which can carry a 4K signal at up to 60Hz — and a port assortment that makes it a good choice for current-gen consoles, 4K Blu-ray players, and streaming devices. If you connect a gaming PC with an AMD graphics card, you can even take advantage of the TV’s support for AMD FreeSync Premium Pro, which reduces graphical glitches such as screen tearing.\nThe U65QF has an LED screen, which means it can’t match the black levels or per-pixel brightness control you’d get with an OLED display. However, its full array lighting panel offers 300 local dimming zones. The TV can control the brightness of each zone to reduce blooming, which is what happens when the area around a bright object (think a lit torch in a cave) looks unnaturally bright. Additionally, the TV has a maximum brightness of 1,000 nits, so the image it produces should look good even in a room with some light interference. The U65QF also supports Dolby Vision, HLG, and HDR10 Plus for better color reproduction, and it features a Hi-View AI chip that automatically processes the image on screen so that it appears sharper.\nAs for its operating system, Hisense’s U65QF runs on Amazon’s Fire OS and features Amazon Alexa built in. You can use the smart assistant to control the TV’s many functions, search for content, control compatible smart home accessories, and look up answers to various questions with your voice. If you want an even larger screen, you can also pick up a 75-inch model for $779.99 ($520 off) at Amazon and Best Buy.\nThe best budget-friendly 4K TV deals\nAmazon Fire TV 4-Series (2024)\nAmazon’s last-gen Fire TV 4-Series is an affordable option if you want to upgrade a smaller HDTV to a 4K model. The 50-inch model is currently on sale for an all-time low of $259.99 ($140 off) at Amazon. The TV features an LED panel with a 60Hz refresh rate and support for HDR10 / HLG, which is totally sufficient for casual TV viewing or watching movies and TV shows. It runs Fire OS, and comes with a remote that allows you to summon Amazon Alexa with the push of a button for a query or command. You can also step up to the 55-inch model for $339.99 ($120 off), its best price to date, if you like its modest feature set but want a slightly larger screen.\nHowever, we should note that Amazon recently released a new 4-Series TV with support for HDR10 Plus, Wi-Fi 6, and Alexa Plus. It also features sensors that’ll automatically turn the TV on when you enter the room, so you can start watching something more quickly.\nHisense QD7\nIf your budget is under $500, the 55-inch Hisense QD7 has a lot to offer, especially now that it’s on sale for an all-time low of $329.99 ($170 off) at Amazon and Best Buy. It features a QLED panel that can deliver more contrast and brightness than a typical LED TV, with support for HDR10 Plus and Dolby Vision, with a peak brightness of 600 nits. The 4K set features a processor capable of AI upscaling and full array local dimming with 160 local dimming zones. A panel with full array local dimming offers better control of brightness and contrast than direct- or edge-lit LED panels (this video from LG shows how it works), providing a more consistent picture across the entire screen. The QD7’s obvious weak point is gaming, due to its 60Hz refresh rate, but if that’s not important to you, it remains a superb value. If you want a larger TV, you can get a 65-inch model for $459.99 ($140 off) at Amazon, which is the lowest price we’ve seen on the larger configuration.\nThe best deals on high-end 4K TVs\nSony Bravia 8 II OLED\nIf you want a TV that produces reference-quality images, Sony’s Bravia 8 II (K65XR80M2) is the best choice. It was recently selected as the top TV in Valve Electronics’ 10th annual TV Shootout based on objective and subjective tests conducted by a panel of experts comparing each set to the image on a $43,000 reference monitor (Disclosure: Verge editor-in-chief Nilay Patel was one of the judges). The 55-inch model also recently received a substantial price cut, dropping it to a new low of $1,998 ($602 off) at Amazon and B&H Photo.\nSony’s premium set has a 120Hz refresh rate panel, with two HDMI 2.1 ports that support 4K at 120Hz, and two HDMI 2.0 ports that top out at 4K / 60Hz. It doesn’t support Nvidia’s G-Sync or AMD’s FreeSync Pro, so there aren’t any specific features on this TV that PC gamers can take advantage of. Sony calls the Bravia 8 II its brightest OLED screen yet, and testing conducted by Hometheaterreview found its maximum brightness was 1,880 nits when viewing HDR content. Its predecessor topped out at 1,300 nits HDR video, or roughly 44 percent dimmer.\nThe TV runs on Sony’s XR processor, which uses AI to adjust the color, contrast, and clarity of whatever you’re watching in real time to look better. The judges in the aforementioned TV Shootout chose Sony’s set as the best model for SDR (Standard Dynamic Range) processing, but third of four models compared for HDR (High Dynamic Range) processing. Any OLED TV can show true black, but judges agreed that the Bravia 8 II pulled ahead in grayscale and contrast when viewing SDR video.\nSony says its TV has modes calibrated for Netflix, Prime Video, and its own Sony Pictures Core streaming services, too. Sony Picture Core is a streaming service that’s available on select Bravia TVs and Sony gaming consoles, and allows you to stream or download 4K movies at far higher bitrates than competing services. The Bravia 8 II comes with 10 credits, which you can use to download movies for offline viewing, and two years of unlimited streaming for films in its catalogue.\nIf you want this TV in a larger size, Amazon, Best Buy, and B&H Photo are all currently offering the 65-inch model for around $2,298 ($1,202 off), which is the lowest price we’ve seen.\nLG C4 OLED\nThe last-gen LG C4 remains one of the best OLED TVs you can buy, and the 65-inch model is currently on sale for around $1,296.99 ($1,403 off) at Amazon, B&H Photo, and Best Buy. Like LG’s newer C5 OLED, it has a 120Hz panel with support for VRR, Nvidia G-Sync, and AMD FreeSync Premium (the option exists to enable a 144Hz mode if you dig in the TV’s options). Its embedded A9 AI Processor Gen7 offers higher-quality video upscaling and image optimization compared to the C3. The biggest difference between the C4 and C5 is their maximum brightness. The C4 tops out at an advertised 1,000 nits, while the C5 tops out at around 1,165 according to tests conducted by Tom’s Guide.\nAdditionally, the C4 features a three-channel audio system, which might sound impressive compared to other TVs, but still can’t compete with a soundbar. When you’re not watching videos or playing games, you can also enable the C4’s Gallery Mode to display art. Basically, the LG C4 offers many of the same features as the C5, but retails for nearly $400 less. You can also save on the 77-inch model, which is on sale for $1,896.99 ($1,600 off) at B&H Photo.\nLG C4\nSony A95L\nSony’s 55-inch A95L is a premium TV with features that should appeal to gamers and cinephiles alike, and you can get it for around $1,598 ($1,202 off) at B&H Photo and Best Buy. The TV has a 120Hz panel and two HDMI 2.1 ports (four HDMI ports total), so you can play games in 4K at up to 120 frames per second. Its two HDMI 2.0 ports are fine for last-gen consoles like the original Nintendo Switch. If you connect a PS5, the TV will adjust its video settings based on the genre of game you’re playing, which is a nice touch, but games on that console will look incredible on any OLED set.\nSony’s Cognitive Processor XR powers the A95L, which enables better motion processing so sports and games look less blurry. It also claims to improve the contrast and colors compared to previous generation Sony TVs. It has a peak brightness of 1,300 nits according to lab tests by Tom’s Guide, which is higher than most of the other OLED TVs we found on sale.\nThe A95L is a Bravia-series TV, which means it can access Sony’s Picture Core. This video on demand service has the highest-bitrate (aka video quality) of any streaming platform, which means what you watch will look closer to an uncompressed 4K Blu-ray than a 4K stream from Netflix. Its library is limited, but Sony includes 10 credits with A95L, so you can download movies to keep forever, and a 24-month subscription that lets you stream videos from the library.\nIf you want a higher-end OLED TV, Sony’s A95L is a great choice and has features you won’t find on non-Sony TVs. You can also get the 77-inch model on sale for around $3,798 ($1,202 off) at Amazon and B&H Photo.\nSamsung S90F\nIf you want an OLED, but don’t have a lot of space, Samsung’s 42-inch S90F is down to a new low of around $897.99 ($300 off) at Amazon, Best Buy, and B&H Photo. The TV features a 120Hz panel and four HDMI 2.1 ports, letting you play games in 4K at up to 120 frames per second. The ability to connect all your current-gen consoles and a gaming PC simultaneously without sacrificing resolution or speed is impressive for an OLED TV under $1,000. The TV can also access Samsung’s Gaming Hub, which allows you to play games available through Nvidia GeForce Go, Amazon Luna, and other cloud gaming services on your TV without any additional hardware — besides a controller, of course.\nThe S90F supports Samsung’s OLED HDR, and it has an NQ4 AI Gen3 processor that optimizes its picture quality and can upscale non-4K video. The TV also runs on Samsung’s Tizen operating system, which offers apps for every major streaming service, and features support for both Alexa and Samsung Bixby, so you can use either virtual assistant to control your various smart home gadgets. If you like the S90F’s features but want a larger TV, the 65-inch model is also on sale for an all-time low of around $1,497.99 ($1,002 off) at Amazon, Best Buy, and B&H Photo.\nUpdate, November 4th: Updated pricing / availability and added deals for Amazon’s Fire TV 4-Series (2024), Hisense’s QD7, and Samsung’s S90F.\nMost Popular\n- iOS 26.1 lets you tweak Liquid Glass, and it’s out now\n- Coca-Cola’s new AI holiday ad is a sloppy eyesore\n- Making KPop Demon Hunters sound magical meant finding the right harmonies\n- Apple TV’s new name now comes with a new sound\n- Google’s TV Streamer (4K) is down to its best price to date ahead of Black Friday", "summary": "(summarizer_error: 401 Client Error: Unauthorized for url: https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions)"}

And happy 35th day of the federal government shutdown, which, as of today, is tied for the longest shutdown in history. But let’s step back for a second, because there’s something these two seemingly unrelated events have in common.\nBack in 2018, two things were constantly in my social media diet: viral videos from WorldStarHipHop.com of people getting into physical fights, and Donald Trump and MAGA influencers instigating Twitter flame wars. Though the content originated from vastly different communities, their most viral posts shared the same qualities: they had to feature a shocking fight, and they had to make their intended audience feel a vicious, vicarious glee about how thoroughly the loser had been beaten up — to the point that no one felt any sympathy toward the loser at all.\nFlash forward seven years, and “WorldStar politics,” as I was calling it back then, has not only entered the mainstream, it’s become an established political norm in America.\nWe still won’t know the results of the hotly contested mayoral race by the time this email’s been sent out, but one thing is for certain. Whether or not he wins, Zohran Mamdani’s skills as a digital communicator — which is kind of like an online influencer, but with much higher societal stakes — did force his primary rival, disgraced former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, to adopt what The New York Times called a “fresh social media persona” to fight Mamdani and his army online. Whether or not Cuomo succeeded at his fresh, new social media persona will only be truly answered once all the votes are tallied. But the fact Cuomo himself had to adapt to internet culture in order to get back into the race underscores a fundamental change in elections and politics. It’s no longer enough to outsource their online presence to an army of 20-something-year-olds churning out memes on their behalf: candidates need to prove that they, themselves, are savvy digital communicators.\nBut it’s not like the 20-something-year-olds won’t lack for work. Although Trump himself is a uniquely singular media figure whose campaigns and presidency have set the standard for how low digital content could go without turning into a complete political liability, his influence has seeped deep into the federal government itself. The MAGA college students and aspiring influencers who watched him run for president in 2016 are now staffing his communications offices across the administration in 2025.\nThe White House is naturally the hub for all MAGA WorldStar content, posting memes from their official accounts meant to both trigger their enemies and satiate their followers — especially when they tie a generally wholesome or anodyne internet trend to a deeply divisive MAGA talking point. (A very brief list of examples: the ASMR migrant deportation video, the AI Ghibli-fied image of Trump deporting a crying woman, the meltdown over the Halo ICE recruitment ads, press secretary Karoline Leavitt and communications director Steven Cheung saying “your mom” in response to a reporter, and so forth.)\nBut the MAGA WorldStar ethos has started seeping into the US government’s official internet presence. WhiteHouse.gov, for instance, recently republished a new presidential history that included photos of perennial MAGA targets: Hunter Biden, Bill Clinton hugging Monica Lewinsky, and Barack Obama in a turban. And as of today, several unfunded federal agencies that play a crucial role in American life have homepage banners explicitly blaming Democrats for the government shutdown — from the Department of Justice and the FDA to the State Department and Health and Human Services. Even now, if you were a SNAP recipient worried about food stamps, and you were to go onto the official US Department of Agriculture website to learn the latest, you’d be met with the following:\n“Senate Democrats have now voted 13 times to not fund the food stamp program, also known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). Bottom line, the well has run dry. At this time, there will be no benefits issued November 01. We are approaching an inflection point for Senate Democrats. They can continue to hold out for healthcare for illegal aliens and gender mutilation procedures or reopen the government so mothers, babies, and the most vulnerable among us can receive critical nutrition assistance.”\nPoliticizing a federal agency’s webpage like this would have been unthinkable in all previous administrations — especially under dire conditions such as a federal government shutdown. But under MAGA WorldStar rules, a .gov webpage is still ultimately a webpage that millions of desperate people will visit. And if you’re a president hell-bent on politicizing the entire federal apparatus to crush your enemies, you might as well treat high-traffic websites you own as a free billboard — and add some shock value to it, too.\nThis week at The Verge:\n- “The government shutdown is delaying new gadgets”, Cameron Faulkner: Confusion, lab shutdowns, and changing rules could lead to even more product delays in the future.\n- “Alleged U Penn hacker claims they’re in it for money, not ‘primarily “anti-DEI”’”, Elizabeth Lopatto: A figure claiming to be one of the hackers says they plan to sell personal data before making it public.\n- “‘Eyes-off driving’ is coming, and we’re so not ready”, Andrew J. Hawkins: Level 3 automation is coming faster than we think. Who will be liable when these systems inevitably make a mistake?\n- “Trump administration charges influencer and congressional candidate over ICE protests”, Stevie Bonifeld: Kat Abughazaleh is charged with conspiracy to impede, as well as assaulting or impeding an ICE officer.\n- “Meta repents again to Republicans in hearing over moderation, while Google stands its ground”, Lauren Feiner: Meanwhile, Democrats just want to hear from FCC Chair Brendan Carr.\n- “Trump says US will restart nuclear weapons testing”, Robert Hart: Something to add to the Nobel Peace Prize submission.\n- “A contentious kids safety bill might be getting gutted — and nobody’s happy”, Lauren Feiner: A centerpiece of the Kids Online Safety Act is rumored to be at risk in the new version.\nAnd now, Recess.\nSpecifically: my recess. Regulator will return on Tuesday, November 25th, and if you’re jonesing for The Verge’s politics and policy coverage in the meantime, there’s a simple hack for that: Go to this webpage, hit “follow”, and presto, it will be on your Verge dot com homepage!\nSee you in two weeks, and if the government is open by then, it’ll be a Thanksgiving miracle.

{"theme": "tech", "title": "Mr Tiff", "url": "https://inventingthefuture.ghost.io/mr-tiff/", "published": "2025-11-04T22:57:12+00:00", "cleaned_text": "For as long as I have published my books, one of my overarching goals was to give credit to those who actually invented the hardware and software that we use.\nI have spent 10,000+ hours to create an accurate record of their work but I'm not complaining. The 'as-close-to-possible' truth of invention by individuals or teams meant identifying the work, educating myself, writing questions, and sending emails. And after that process, I set up a chat because it all gets down to talking to someone on the other side of the world, about something that happened 30 or 40 years ago.\nIf the invention involves a team, I try to interview more than one person, so I can cross-check the facts. Not to call anyone out, it’s just that, given time, we all forget the facts. And everyone adds their personal take. It’s because of that, for example, that I know the English musician Peter Gabriel really did visit Apple's research labs as they tested the Apple Sound Chip, and gave the team his personal approval to use the song 'Red Rain' for the Macintosh II launch. Wil Oxford, Steve Perlman, Mike Potel, Mark Lentczner and Steve Milne told me so.\nAs I was wrapping up Version 2.3 of Inventing the Future, I spoke with Steve M and Mark about the AIFF (Audio Interchange File Format) audio standard that they built around the same time as their VIP visit. They did so as professional programmers, amateur musicians and electronic music experts. Milne and Lentczner knew users needed a standard file format to make their work lives easier and to fend off confusion in the nascent MIDI marketplace. But it didn't exist. So Steve and Mark consulted with users and manufacturers in the Apple cafeteria after hours. This work is interesting on its own but it also underpinned other research. The AIFF, Apple Sound Chip, and MIDI Manager work scaffolded QuickTime and its extensible video formats and programs in 1991. Senior engineer Toby Farrand told me:\nAudio drove the development of QuickTime more than anything.\nSo who or what drove the development of AIFF?\nSteve and Mark referred me to the IFF (Interchange File Format (IFF) and the TIFF (Tag Image File Format) that were built before AIFF, in 1985 and 1986 respectively. These file formats were the benchmark for open media standards. My search pivoted, as it always does, to understand those inventions. I expected to be able to find the engineer or engineers names, track them down and interview them. It has worked around 100 times before.\nJerry Morrison created IFF while working at Electronic Arts and then went to Apple, where he liaised with the AIFF team. I could easily background his work.\nSo I turned my attention to TIFF, built initially as an image standard for desktop publishing. TIFF was able to store monochrome, grayscale, and color images, alongside metadata such as size, compression algorithms, and color space information. In many ways, it was a lot like AIFF so I was keen to know more. But I couldn't find a TIFF creator. No matter how I enquired, Aldus created TIFF.\nTo be clear, while a search for AIFF will offer up a company (Apple) not a person, I was able to find Milne and Lentczner in part because of their unique names and because Apple publicised the AIFF work and those publications are archived.\nAll I had was Aldus, an American company that created desktop publishing with the help of Apple and Adobe. In fact, Paul Brainerd, the cofounder of Aldus coined the term 'desktop publishing' to quickly explain the technicality of what they were doing to potential investors. But Aldus and their seminal product, PageMaker, are long gone, and there were no breadcrumbs for TIFF's creation.\nFinally, after a day-long trawl through MacWeek back issues, I found Steve Carlson. (below)\nThen I ran a similar length search through the Computer History Museum’s amazing Oral Histories transcriptions. Brainerd mentioned Carlson's name in an interview. (below)\nBut it was too brief an explanation so I kept looking. Then the trail went cold.\nAnd that was because, folks had misspelt his name when quoting him and then that was copied into magazines, and reviews and so forth. Brainerd's CHM interview transcript was wrong. But I didn’t know that.\nI just kept looking for Steve Carlson.\nI found other inventors because they had unique middle or last names or by random methods such as searching glider pilot licences in the Napa Valley after a tip from a former colleague that 'so and so' was a pilot in retirement. I had no tips, no links, nothing.\nWhy couldn’t I find Steve Carlson?\nAll the while, the answer was right under my nose. I had downloaded the final Aldus TIFF specifications document, hoping to find the author’s name. However, the name is seemingly written in white text on white paper - making it invisible. What?\nSee below where I have highlighted the region with a blue block over the text.\nFor a reason I can’t recall, I downloaded a plain text version and typed in Carlson to see if he was mentioned, but I must have paused at ‘Carls...' and the search functionality automatically filled in the rest. Suddenly I was staring at:\nAuthor/Editor/Arbitrator: Steve Carlsen.\n‘Carls-EN’\nA quick trip to Google patents, and a search for Steve Carlsen, Stephen Carlsen. Bingo! Stephen E. Carlsen’s patents at Aldus (and Adobe) in Issaquah, WA.\nI checked the geography, as most folks of a certain age do not stray far from the addresses filed in their patents, and typed Stephen’s correctly spelled surname into the online US White Pages for Washington State. There was ‘a’ Stephen Carlsen listed in a retirement village in WA. His age matched, but there were no public facing email addresses.\nI searched bulletin boards on the topic of TIFF, as I had found a former Apple engineer that way. Don had picked an abbreviation of his initials and numbers to post on BBS in his college days and then carried that same combination into adulthood. Many of us did. I took a punt pasting his unique prefix into hotmail, gmail etc. and found Don and interviewed him, but - Stephen Carlsen did not show up in a BBS. So, no email to try.\nMy ‘last straw' method for finding someone is a stamped envelope. I wrote, printed and mailed a one-page letter to Stephen's listed address, and crossed my fingers. Four months later he popped up in my email.\nIt was a surprise and a relief. We swapped a few emails, and he confirmed the TIFF catalyst story. For Stephen it was 'no big deal'. Once he had built the initial TIFF, Aldus needed to convince 3rd party developers and scanner manufacturers to agree to TIFF as a standard.\n“We had to define and promote an industry standard for storing and processing scanned images, so that we wouldn't have to write import filters for every model of every scanner that would soon be entering the budding desktop scanner market.\"\nStephen himself did much of the evangelizing as Paul Brainerd later pointed out:\n“(Steve) developed the standard, and then we went out and promoted it in a series of meetings with specific companies - as well as some workshops we ran in Seattle and the Bay Area during the Seybold shows and the MacWorld shows.”\nI sent Stephen a draft of what I had written and he sent a prompt reply saying - ‘Looks good’.\nI followed up asking him how he ended up at a tiny startup in Seattle called Aldus.\nAt that time, I was interviewing for a graphics position at Boeing Computer Services in Seattle, and noticed a small wanted ad that sounded really interesting, and seemed to be an excellent match for my background and interests. I interviewed with Paul and the 5-person mostly-ex-Atex engineering team, and I was hired.\nOut of curiosity I put Stephen's email address, now that I knew it, into a Duck Duck search and found him helping people online with TIFF queries long after Aldus had been acquired by Adobe. He also contributed to a Google Group called tiffcentral.\nHaving interviewed so many people across more than a decade, I’ve got pretty good at judging those who would like to talk or type, those who are verbose and those that are not. I knew Stephen had said what he was going to say. I added his pioneering work on TIFF to the AIFF story and moved on.\nTwo years had flown by when I received an email yesterday. His ex-wife Peggy found my paper letter and wrote to me. Stephen passed away earlier this year.\nThank you for your interest in and support of Stephen’s brilliant work creating TIFF. I’m not surprised Stephen didn’t finish corresponding with you, as he had begun to struggle with using his computer and phone. Some days were better than others for him, but he began to lose touch with people during those months you were reaching out to him. He was a humble man, and I guess never pushed to be recognized, although I believe those who worked with him knew the truth. His last week was in my home, where he was never left alone.\nPeggy finished the email with, ‘I called him Mr TIFF up to his last moment.'\nThe 10,000+ hours of book research disappeared in an instant. As sad as it was, I could see clearly that all of my work was worth it. Every single second. Because of this email.\nMr TIFF.\nLast night, as everyone in my house went to sleep, I took a deep breath and edited the Wikipedia page for TIFF, the Tag Image File Format.\nIt no longer reads ‘created by Aldus’, it reads ‘…created by Stephen Carlsen, an engineer at Aldus'", "summary": "(summarizer_error: 401 Client Error: Unauthorized for url: https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions)"}

The wave of infections grew to 10% of the entire Internet within 24 hours, causing astronomically expensive damage for the time. However, the pioneering Morris worm malware wasn’t made with malice, says an FBI retrospective on the “programming error.” It was designed to gauge the size of the Internet, resulting in a classic case of unintended consequences.\nMorris worm dissection\nKnown to be something of a prankster, Morris must have felt some foreboding about releasing his ‘innocent’ program into the wild. Evidence of this comes from his release method. “He released it by hacking into an MIT computer from his Cornell terminal in Ithaca, New York,” according to the FBI.\nThe Morris worm was written in C and targeted BSD UNIX systems, like VAX and Sun-3 machines. Specifically, the FBI writes, it “exploited a backdoor in the Internet’s electronic mail system and a bug in the ‘finger’ program that identified network users.” In contrast to computer viruses, the worm Morris had devised had no need of a host program, but could self-replicate and spread autonomously.\nThankfully, the Morris worm wasn’t written to cause damage to files. Due to those unintended consequences, though, it precipitated massive slowdowns, and messaging delays and system crashes were common symptoms. It became a computer news sensation in the worst possible way. Just to get rid of the worm in a timely fashion, some institutions ended up wiping complete systems and unplugging networks for as long as a week.\nAmong the Morris worm's casualties were prestigious institutions such as Berkeley, Harvard, Princeton, Stanford, Johns Hopkins, NASA, and the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.\nWhodunit?\nExperts worked hard to find a fix, and while they did so, the question of who was behind the worm came to the fore. Understandably, whoever created and unleashed this worm needed to feel some consequences, and thus, the FBI was brought in.\nApparently, Morris sought to anonymously explain and apologize for the worm, but an inadvertent slip of his initials by a friend landed Morris in it.\nGet Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.\nFBI interviews and computer file analysis would subsequently confirm Morris was the culprit. He was indicted under the rather freshly inked Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986. After a court appearance for his misdemeanors in 1989, Morris ended up not with jail time, but with a fine, probation, and 400 hours of community service to complete.\nComputer worms have been around longer than the World Wide Web\nBack in November 1988, the Internet bore little resemblance to what it is today. For example, the World Wide Web (WWW) wasn’t even a thing. Though the WWW would soon form the core experience for the first tide of surfers in the 90s.\nAt the time, the Internet’s backbone was the NSFNET, the recent successor to ARPANET. Its purpose was mostly to expand the prior backbone’s reach beyond military and defense institutions, and it more broadly embraced academia. While we are here, it is worth mentioning that NSFNET was decommissioned in 1995, and succeeded by the commercial Internet, which emerged in the 1990s off the back of private ISPs and commercial backbones.\nSo, when we talk about 10% of the Internet being paralyzed by the Morris Worm, contemporary estimates are that about 6,000 of the approximately 60,000 connected systems were infected and impacted. Moreover, when we highlighted the potentially massive costs of this first worm propagating, estimates range from $100,000 to millions of dollars.\nComputer worms have remained a scary phenomenon in recent times. For example, we reported on the first-generation AI worm, the Morris II generative AI worm, last year.\nFollow Tom's Hardware on Google News, or add us as a preferred source, to get our latest news, analysis, & reviews in your feeds.\nMark Tyson is a news editor at Tom's Hardware. He enjoys covering the full breadth of PC tech; from business and semiconductor design to products approaching the edge of reason.\n-\nsb5k I was working at DEC when the worm slithered its way across the Internet, as part of an engineering team. I also helped manage our Ultrix systems; our IT department knew VMS only.Reply\nI don't remember which CPU was in our systems, but the worm was not able to run on our systems, but I did find it dropped in them. -\nGaston404 I completely disagree with the tone of the article. Depicting this as an accident without consequences and limited effect is simply incorrect.Reply\nBack then as a part time job I managed some of the traffic routing through Washington DC. Mail relays were shutdown and backed up queues were spooked off to tape. By today’s standards the volume of traffic may seem trivial but when many of these links ran at 56kbps or less. It was a mess. The main way administrators communicated with each other was email. This also affected collaboration between University researchers and access to the NSF super computer centers.\nAt the time rumors maintained that Morris used exploits that he learned from his father who had a consulting agreement with the NSA. So if this is true there is a certain level of non-originality.\nOn one hand stronger persecution may have reduced follow on internet crime. On the other hand the fragility demonstrated by this crime, resulted in the creation of procedures to deal with outages. If anything the naive sense of trusted collaboration that pervaded the Internet started to fade. -\nderekullo In 9 years, Tiktok has infected over 90% of the internet!Reply\nMuch slower but also much more insidious! -\nDS426 Reply\nThe next big social media craze is probably just around the corner.

The feature, called Personas, involves two or more users, all wearing Vision Pros, chatting with one another in real time but as virtual replicas.\nNow out of beta, Personas are part of Apple's avatar system for the Vision Pro, creating replicas of yourself via a 3D photo scan.\nTaking a scan of myself isn't a new thing. Some five years ago, I tried telepresence with 3D-scanned avatars on Nreal AR glasses with a company called Spatial. I've gotten peeks at Meta's realistic codec avatars. I explored cartoon avatar telepresence with Microsoft in HoloLens. And I've even scanned myself into all sorts of bizarre AI deepfakes using OpenAI's Sora phone app.\nStill, no one is doing anything in VR or AR headsets or glasses as advanced as Apple's Vision Personas. And we haven't seen the beginning of how good things could get.\nTo learn more, I donned an M5 Vision Pro headset and jumped into a FaceTime for an exclusive chat with Apple's senior director of the Vision Products Group, Jeff Norris, and the senior director of product marketing, Steve Sinclair. The two showed up as Personas in my home office. We wandered in like ghosts when the meeting started, face to face, so to speak. After a few minutes, it felt like we were actually spending time together in person.\nApple doesn't discuss the future. But Norris and Sinclair did explain some of the very cool 3D tech that makes Personas seem so realistic. As we chatted, I imagined that similar scans could be done on places other than Vision Pro, like maybe your iPhone, which would be accessible to more people.\nReal telepresence is expensive magic\nIt's hard to find another person who has a Vision Pro, but when I have, the eerie sense of someone ghost-walking into my home is like wizardry. Apple's VisionOS has evolved to allow collaboration between Personas, flexing virtual spaces out for up to five people to see and share virtual objects and apps together. Multiple people in the same room wearing Vision headsets can collaborate with Personas that can beam in remotely, as well.\nI've dreamed of that Tony Stark-like, Star Wars-hologram telepresence idea for years now. It's basically here. It's just walled into very expensive hardware.\nSmart glasses haven't been able to handle the load of avatars like this yet, although AR glasses from Snap and others may be trying soon. My question for Apple is: What technology is making Personas happen, and could it ever appear anywhere else?\nSplatting scan technology uses machine learning\nIn our meeting, Norris explains that Persona technology uses Gaussian splatting to create those surprisingly convincing 3D facial scans. Gaussian splatting is the key tech to many 3D applications right now, often applied to scanning objects or large-scale environments. Meta's Hyperscape Capture app on Quest can scan whole rooms into 3D-walkable spaces in VR, for example. It knits a 3D image or landscape from a series of 2D images using AI.\nWhat makes Personas unique is the focus on scanning yourself instead of your environment. Using VisionOS 26, Norris showed me the key changes from the earlier Persona versions. The renders can now show greater detail at multiple angles and capture details like jewelry and eyelashes. Bodies and faces are scanned together, which makes the render feel more seamless.\n\"There's machine learning involved, but not many people really realize that it's a concert of networks that come together,\" says Norris. \"We counted them up, it's over a dozen, but we actually reduced the number when we moved to this new version of Personas.\"\nI mentioned the possibility of scanning rooms into Vision Pro down the road (apps like Scaniverse and Polycam already show off 3D scans in headsets). Norris says Apple is already applying Gaussian splatting to the spatial 3D conversions of photos, which now look weirdly immersive in headsets. So, what's next?\nIt doesn't take much to capture the photos needed. Could it be done on iPhones?\nEven though the Persona scan is done via Vision Pro's headset, which requires me to hold up the headset to turn my head and scan, it's not a process that requires me to use Vision Pro's sensors extensively.\n\"We only need a handful of images when we are enrolling your Persona,\" Norris tells me. \"That includes a few facial expressions to help our networks understand how your face moves when you're talking and smiling. And that's it.\"\nI wonder whether an iPhone could eventually scan a Persona, which I'd find a lot easier than using the Vision Pro. Norris doesn't answer that directly.\n\"It's interesting to imagine different ways of accomplishing that,\" he responds. \"But right now, we love that it's self-contained to the device and that all the processing happens on the device. None of these images have to go anywhere in order for that to happen.\"\nWhat could this mean for our future sense of virtual identity?\nThe single Persona I scan and bond to my Apple ID on Vision Pro feels like it's designed to act as a one-to-one mapping for my virtual self. It's the closest thing Apple has to a substitute for using a camera to broadcast my actual face, which can't be done since I'm wearing a headset.\nAI companies are already scanning and generating virtual versions of people in increasing numbers of deepfakes, both intentional and unintentional. OpenAI's Sora app is the most prominent example now, and uses a similar type of face-scanning tech on iPhones to generate a \"Cameo\" of myself I can lend out to others.\nI ask Norris where the line can be drawn going forward. He makes it clear that Apple wants to clearly and securely represent a person in real time, not as a reproduction.\n\"We have focused Personas on that authentic representation goal,\" he says. \"We're trying to grant what I think is a fundamental human wish, which is: 'I wish you were here.' That begins by trying to be faithful to how we appear, and how we're moving, and how we're emoting as we speak.\"\nCan I have more than one Persona, or more customization?\nRight now, Apple limits you to using one Persona scan at a time, which surprises me. I'd love a variety of Scott Stein avatars in different moods or simply with different clothes. While Apple doesn't explore identity transformation via scans, I do appreciate the options for realistic glasses, and I'd love to be able to add more accessories.\n\"People can reenroll or just put on a different shirt and enroll again,\" says Norris. \"I totally understand why that would be something we'd want. But we're focusing on just the one at a time right now.\"\nWould Personas ever extend outside Vision Pro?\nI'm already thinking about more options for Personas, not just for Apple's expensive headset, but for iPhones and other devices.\nWhat if they could be personal stand-ins on our FaceTime calls? I can already call my wife on FaceTime from Vision Pro, and she can see my 2D Persona there. She laughs at it because it feels somewhat supernatural. If Apple has already opened the doorway this much with Animoji on FaceTime, why not Personas too?\nNorris insists that Personas work better in the Vision headset, which I agree with. The renderings feel more convincing, somehow. When we place ourselves in environments that are already half-composed of virtual things, these 3D-scanned identities appear more natural. But physical distance and body expressions can also happen in space. Personas can leave their box and hover around as torsos, hands and faces.\n\"I can tell a joke and you're gonna get it because you're gonna see my body language, and see my facial expressions that you don't see on a two-dimensional screen,\" says Sinclair. \"Here, we're in the room together, and it feels like we really are here.\"\nAs his Persona stands next to my cluttered desk in that virtual form, I realize he's right.\nApple is already receiving feedback about this for business uses. \"We're hearing about it in healthcare as well,\" Norris says. \"Doctors who create procedures and want to train other people. They don't have to travel around the country. They can just get on a FaceTime call with their Personas.\"\nI still see a future where iPhones, iPads, laptops and headsets all collaborate together, something companies like Microsoft and Qualcomm have pointed to as a bridge between headsets and flat-screen devices. Samsung and Google are discussing those types of connecting points with Android XR, too. Apple has an ARKit on iPhones and iPads, so the possibilities already exist.\nNorris says that Personas outside of a headset would be missing something right now. \"To get the full appreciation of the experience, you kind of have to have both the sensing capabilities and the incredible display capabilities. They really have to kind of come together to create a magic moment like this.\"\nAs Apple moves toward an expected line of smart glasses in the future, and inevitably toward more advanced iPhones and iPads, that philosophy could evolve. Personas are the start of a fundamental change in how we handle collaboration and connection.\nFor the moment, however, you'll never experience it unless you're inside a Vision Pro. I look forward to a time when the entry ticket into this magic telepresence world is far more affordable and better distributed, so more people can come aboard.\nRight now, my Persona is mainly by itself. I'd love it if I could get some company more often.\nDon't miss any of our unbiased tech content and lab-based reviews.

This process runs DuckDB together with our duckdb_pglake extension, which adds PostgreSQL-compatible functions and behavior.\nUsers typically don’t need to be aware of pgduck_server\n; it operates transparently to improve performance. When appropriate, pg_lake\ndelegates scanning of the data and the computation to DuckDB’s highly parallel, column-oriented execution engine.\nThis separation also avoids the threading and memory-safety limitations that would arise from embedding DuckDB directly inside the Postgres process, which is designed around process isolation rather than multi-threaded execution. Moreover, it lets us interact with the query engine directly by connecting to it using standard Postgres clients.\nThe team behind pg_lake has a lot of experience building Postgres extensions (e.g. Citus, pg_cron, pg_documentdb). Over time, we’ve learned that large, monolithic PostgreSQL extensions are harder to evolve and maintain.\npg_lake\nfollows a modular design built around a set of interoperating components — mostly implemented as PostgreSQL extensions, others as supporting services or libraries.\nEach part focuses on a well-defined layer, such as table and metadata management, catalog and object store integration, query execution, or data format handling. This approach makes it easier to extend, test, and evolve the system, while keeping it familiar to anyone with a PostgreSQL background.\nThe current set of components are:\n- pg_lake_iceberg: a PostgreSQL extension that implements the Iceberg specification\n- pg_lake_table: a PostgreSQL extension that implements a foreign data wrapper to query files in object storage\n- pg_lake_copy: a PostgreSQL extension that implements COPY to/from your data lake\n- pg_lake_engine: a common module for different pg_lake extensions\n- pg_extension_base: A foundational building block for other extensions\n- pg_extension_updater: An extension for updating all extensions on start-up. See README.md.\n- pg_lake_benchmark: a PostgreSQL extension that performs various benchmarks on lake tables. See README.md.\n- pg_map: A generic map type generator\n- pgduck_server: a stand-alone server that loads DuckDB into the same server machine and exposes DuckDB via the PostgreSQL protocol\n- duckdb_pglake: a DuckDB extension that adds missing PostgreSQL functions to DuckDB\npg_lake\ndevelopment started in early 2024 at Crunchy Data with the goal of bringing Iceberg to PostgreSQL. The first few months were focused on building a robust integration of an external query engine (DuckDB). To get to market early, we made the query/import/export features available to Crunchy Bridge customers as Crunchy Bridge for Analytics.\nNext, we started building a comprehensive implementation of the Iceberg (v2) protocol with support for transactions and almost all PostgreSQL features. In November 2024, we relaunched Crunchy Bridge for Analytics as Crunchy Data Warehouse available on Crunchy Bridge and on-premises.\nIn June 2025, Crunchy Data was acquired by Snowflake. Following the acquisition, Snowflake decided to open source the project as pg_lake\nin November 2025. The initial version is 3.0 because of the two prior generations.

The magazine featured essays and articles, but was primarily focused on product reviews. The editorial focus was on self-sufficiency, ecology, alternative education, âdo it yourself,â and holism, featuring the slogan âaccess to tools.â\nâ¡ CoEvolution Quarterly\nFounded in 1974 by the staff of the Whole Earth Catalog, CoEvolution Quarterly lasted 10 years as a small circulation magazine whose titular founding idea was coined by zoologist Paul Ehrlich and botanist Peter Raven to account for events that neither of their separate disciplines could explain. The moral of the co-evolutionary perspective is its imperative to always look one level larger and one level finer (at least) than where you are, and to see clear through your cycles.\nArticles include wide-ranging topics such as Paul Ehrlich on the biology of communities, R.

The US Department of Homeland Security wants to greatly expand biometric data collection for immigration applications, covering immigrants and even some US citizens tied to those cases.\nDHS, through its component agency US Citizenship and Immigration Services, on Monday proposed a sweeping expansion of the agency's collection of biometric data. While ostensibly about verifying identities and preventing fraud in immigration benefit applications, the proposed rule goes much further than simply ensuring applicants are who they claim to be.\nFirst off, the rule proposes expanding when DHS can collect biometric data from immigration benefit applicants, as \"submission of biometrics is currently only mandatory for certain benefit requests and enforcement actions.\" DHS wants to change that, including by requiring practically everyone an immigrant is associated with to submit their biometric data.\n\"DHS proposes in this rule that any applicant, petitioner, sponsor, supporter, derivative, dependent, beneficiary, or individual filing or associated with a benefit request or other request or collection of information, including U.S. citizens, U.S. nationals and lawful permanent residents, and without regard to age, must submit biometrics unless DHS otherwise exempts the requirement,\" the rule proposal said.\nDHS also wants to require the collection of biometric data from \"any alien apprehended, arrested or encountered by DHS.\"\nIt's not explicitly stated in the rule proposal why US citizens associated with immigrants who are applying for benefits would have to have their biometric data collected. DHS didn't answer questions to that end, though the rule stated that US citizens would also be required to submit biometric data \"when they submit a family-based visa petition.\"\nGive me your voice, your eye print, your DNA samples\nIn addition to expanded collection, the proposed rule also changes the definition of what DHS considers to be valid biometric data.\n\"Government agencies have grouped together identifying features and actions, such as fingerprints, photographs, and signatures under the broad term, biometrics,\" the proposal states. \"DHS proposes to define the term 'biometrics' to mean 'measurable biological (anatomical, physiological or molecular structure) or behavioral characteristics of an individual,'\" thus giving DHS broad leeway to begin collecting new types of biometric data as new technologies are developed.\nThe proposal mentions several new biometric technologies DHS wants the option to use, including ocular imagery, voice prints and DNA, all on the table per the new rule.\n\"The rule proposes to grant DHS express authority to require, request, or accept raw DNA or DNA test results,\" DHS said, including \"to prove or disprove … biological sex\" in situations where that can affect benefit eligibility.\nDHS wants to use all that data for identity enrollment, verification and management of the immigration lifecycle, national security and criminal history checks, \"the production of secure identity documents,\" to prove familial relationships, and to perform other administrative functions, the rule states.\n- Facial recognition works better in the lab than on the street, researchers show\n- EU biometric border system launch hits inevitable teething problems\n- Vietnam to collect biometrics - even DNA - for new ID cards\n- Altman's eyeball-scanning biometric blockchain orbs officially come to America\nAs we noted in our story last week about DHS' new rule expanding biometric data collection on entry into and exit from the US, biometric technology - especially the often-used facial recognition scan - is ripe for misuse and prone to errors.\nThis new proposed rule goes far beyond subjecting immigrants to algorithmic identification tech prone to misidentifying non-white individuals, however, and reaches a new level of surveillance, with DHS seeking to collect and keep DNA test results - including partial profiles - from immigrants and some US citizens to verify family ties or biological sex when relevant. It's not much more assuring that DHS also wants to collect new forms of biometric data like voice records, which are increasingly easy to spoof with AI.\nWhen we asked DHS questions about its biometric expansion proposal, it only sent us a statement identical to the one it sent last week when we inquired about the new entry/exit biometric requirements. The agency didn't respond when we asked for a statement pertaining to this latest proposed rule.\nDHS is taking comments on the proposal until January 2; so far the submissions are nearly entirely negative, with posters decrying the plan as government overreach, comparing the proposal to communist China, and calling it a violation of Constitutional guarantees against unreasonable search and seizure. ®", "summary": "(summarizer_error: 401 Client Error: Unauthorized for url: https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions)"}

So it’s only when you have your code in your head that you really understand the problem.” — Paul Graham\nSoftware development only becomes engineering with understanding. Your ability to reason through your most challenging coding tasks is constrained by your mental model of how things work — in other words, how quickly and how well you onboard to any codebase for solving any problem. However most AI vibe coding tools are aimed at relieving you of that burden by reading → thinking → writing the code for you, increasing the separation from you and your code. This is fine for low value, commodity tasks, but absolutely unacceptable for the hard, sensitive, and high value work that defines real engineering.\nWe all need more AI that turns your brain ON, not OFF.\nToday we are announcing Windsurf Codemaps, which are first-of-its-kind AI-annotated structured maps of your code, powered by SWE-1.5 and Claude Sonnet 4.5. Building on our popular work from DeepWiki and Ask Devin, Codemaps is the next step in hyper-contextualized codebase understanding, grounded in precise code navigation.\nEvery engineering task — debugging, refactors, new features — starts with understanding. Great engineers aren’t just good at writing code; they’re good at reading it, building mental models that span files, layers, and systems.\nBut modern codebases are sprawling: hundreds of files, multiple services, dense abstractions. Based on own experience and deep conversations with our customers across the Fortune 500, even top engineers spend much of their deep-work time finding and remembering what matters.\nIt’s a huge tax on productivity:\nThis is the frontier that AI coding tools haven’t yet solved. Onboarding isn’t even a onetime cost, you pay it every time you switch context and codebases. The faster and better you understand your codebase, the faster and better you’ll be able to fix it yourself, or prompt agents to do it.\nUntil today, the standard approach by Copilot, Claude Code, Codex, and even Windsurf Cascade, was to have you ask questions of a generalist agent with access to your code in a typical chat experience. But those solutions don’t solve focused onboarding and strongly grounded navigation to onboard, debug, and better context engineer for your codebase.\nAt Cognition, we’ve been investing far more deeply in understanding:\nCodemaps is our next investment in tooling that makes engineers the best versions of themselves.\nWhen you first open Codemaps (click the new maps icon or Cmd+Shift+C in Windsurf) with a codebase opened in Windsurf, you can enter in a prompt for the task you are trying to do, or take one of the automatic suggestions. You can choose a Fast (SWE-1.5) or Smart (Sonnet 4.5) model to generate your Codemap. Every Codemap is a snapshot of your code and respects ZDR.\nBased on our demos to customers, you will experience Codemaps best on your own codebase and asking a question about how or where some functionality works. In our dogfooding, we find particular effectiveness tracing through client-server problems or a data pipeline or debugging auth/security issues:\nIf all you wanted was to quickly jump through grouped and nested parts of your code that related to your question, this is already an improvement compared to asking the same question in Cascade, where answers are not as densely linked to the exact lines of code.\nYou can also toggle over to a visually drawn Codemap, which performs the same functions when you click on individual nodes: they send you to the exact part of the codebase you clicked on.\nHowever, if you want a little more context, then you can hit “See more” in any section to expand our “trace guide” that gives a more descriptive explanation of what groups the discovered lines together.\nFinally, inside Cascade you can also reference a codemap for the agent with @{codemap}\n(all of it, or a particular subsection) in your prompt to provide more specific context and dramatically improve the performance of your agent for your task.\nWe feel that the popular usage of “vibe coding” has strayed far from the original intent, into a blanket endorsement of plowing through any and all AI generated code slop. If you look at the difference between the most productive vs the problematic AI-assisted coders, the productive ones can surf the vibes of code that they understand well, whereas people get into trouble when the code they generate and maintain starts to outstrip their ability to understand it.\nTo understand is to be accountable. As AI takes on more of the easy work, the hard problems left to humans are the ones that demand real comprehension: debugging complex systems, refactoring legacy code, making architecture decisions. In this new era, the engineer’s role shifts from authoring to accountability — you might not write every line, but you’re still responsible for what ships. That accountability depends on understanding what the AI produced, why it changed, and whether it’s safe. Codemaps closes that gap by giving both the human and the AI a shared picture of the system: how it’s structured, how data flows, where dependencies live. Codemaps is our latest Fast Agent, but as we discussed in the Semi-Async Valley of Death, our goal isn't just about speed, it is to help your human engineers stay in flow, stay on top of their code, and to move faster and more confidently on the hardest problems, never shipping slop that they don't understand.\nAugment engineers for high value work, relieve them of low value work. The other local minima that the coding agent industry has gotten stuck in is in the general messaging of replacing engineers for low value work and not having any solutions for the hardest tasks apart from “pls ultrathink high, no mistakes”, which only gives autonomy to the agent, at the expense of the engineer. The long history of human-machine collaboration teaches us that we can always do more with the synergy rather than humans-alone or AI-alone. Our view is that the AI product that engineers will love most is the one that makes them better at their job, not the one that tries to replace them with a sloppy facsimile of themselves.\nWith Codemaps, we are now exposing to humans some of the indexing and analysis we do inside of our coding agents. These artifacts are sharable today across teams for learning and discussion, but we have yet to benchmark how much better they can make our coding agents like Devin and Cascade in solving challenging tasks on their own. We also see opportunities for connecting and annotating codemaps, as well as defining an open .codemap\nprotocol that can be used by other code agents and custom tooling built by you. Complementing our Fast Context feature, this is an advancement in human-readable automatic context engineering.\nYou can try Codemaps on the latest versions of Windsurf, or DeepWiki!", "summary": "(summarizer_error: 401 Client Error: Unauthorized for url: https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions)"}

In effect, digital footprints are the new credit scores.\"\nThe following report is set to appear in the latest edition of the monthly publication. Revive The Table. You can preorder a physical copy on the website.\nEarlier this year, World Economic Forum founder Klaus Schwab was effectively forced out of his own globalist group he founded decades ago. Ascending to Schwab’s role, André Hoffmann - a Swiss billionaire and great-grandson of Fritz Hoffmann-La Roche, who founded the drug company Roche - and Larry Fink were selected as the interim Co-Chairs of the WEF.1 The WEF, as we know, is the controversial group that tells us that we, among many other controversial things, will “own nothing and be happy” by 2030.\nThe two indicated in August that their ascendance signified a “pivotal transition” in the WEF’s agenda, writing:\n“We are honored to take on this leadership role on an interim basis at a pivotal time for the World Economic Forum. As the organization moves into a new chapter, we look ahead with clarity, purpose, and confidence in the Forum’s enduring mission.\n“The world is more fragmented and complex than ever, but the need for a platform that brings together business, government, and civil society has never been greater. We believe the Forum can serve as a unique catalyst for cooperation, one that fosters trust, identifies shared goals, and turns dialogue into action.\n“We remain optimistic. The Forum has an opportunity to help drive international collaboration in a way that not only generates prosperity but distributes it more broadly. This renewed vision can promote open markets and national priorities side by side, while advancing the interests of workers and stakeholders globally.\n“We look forward to helping shape a more resilient and prosperous future, and to reinventing and strengthening the Forum as an indispensable institution for public-private cooperation.”\nLarry Fink heads BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager that oversees nearly $13.5 trillion2 in its portfolio - a number that continues to rapidly rise each year. BlackRock has massive amounts of control and leverage over thousands of companies across all sectors valued at $4.35 Trillion.3\nTrump has had a good relationship with BlackRock CEO Larry Fink. Prior to becoming President for the first time, Fink had helped manage Trump’s finances, and after a 2017 meeting with his administration, Fink acknowledged his relationship with Trump,4 noting: “In every meeting we had, he talked about doing more… I didn’t think ‘doing more’ meant [being] the president.” Three years later, Trump called upon Fink once again to oversee the stimulus distribution programs alongside former majority5 BlackRock shareholder, Bank of America. “I do believe it’s going to continue to bring opportunities for us,” Fink stated during a 2020 earnings call, referring to government assignments. Trump said6 during that 2017 meeting: “Larry did a great job for me. He managed a lot of my money. I have to tell you, he got me great returns.”\nThis brings us to tokenization. As we have discussed in the two previous issues of Revive The Table, tokenization is the new monetary financial system quietly transforming the world, digitizing all assets and money in the form of a digital, trackable, traceable, permissioned token traded on blockchain ledgers.\nAs a refresher - a “token,” as defined7 by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) - nicknamed the “central bank of central banks” - “are entries in a database that are recorded digitally and that can contain information and functionality within the token themselves. Digital tokens can represent financial or real assets.” These assets can be virtually anything: stocks, bonds, real estate, commodities such as food or oil, things priced/measured in carbon, precious metals, “money” (so-called); and even the individual themselves becomes a token via digital ID. A token collects information8 about that underlying digital currency or asset: ownership, dates of purchase/sale, transaction dates, permissions and rights, and so forth. And, as we examined in our last report, citing an official White House document9 published in July about the future financial system, it’s not just the Trump administration building this, but the whole world is racing towards it in accordance with these globalist playbooks.\nLarry Fink has been a major advocate for tokenization and digitizing assets, as I have previously reported, and just recently he restated the necessity of tokenization. In an interview with CNBC,10 Fink pronounced that “We’re at the beginning of the tokenization of all assets.”\n“You know, I do believe we're just at the beginning of the tokenization of all assets, from real estate, to equity, to bonds, across the board. […] So we look at that as the next wave of opportunity for BlackRock over the next tens of years as we start focusing on moving away from traditional financial assets by repotting them in a digital manner, and then having people stay in that digital ecosystem.”\nIn 2024, Fink echoed a similar sentiment11 but introduced the concept of digital ID (without saying it), revealing that everyone will have “our own identification” in this new digital sphere.\n“We believe the next step going forward will be the tokenization of all assets and that means every stock and every bond will have its own, basically, CUSIP [a nine-character numeric or alphanumeric code that uniquely identifies a North American financial security for the purposes of facilitating clearing and settlement of trades, which id’s most financial products].\n“It will be on one general ledger. Every investor, you and I, will have our own number, our own identification. We can rid ourselves of all issues around illicit activities around bonds and stocks and digital by having tokenization…. We would have instantaneous settlement. Think of all the costs of settling bonds and stocks, but if you had a tokenization, everything would be immediate because it is just a line item. We believe this is a technology transformation for financial assets.”\nEarlier this year, Fink published his “Annual Chairman’s Letter to Investors” titled, “The Democratization of Investing.”12 In it was a dedicated section to tokenization and digital IDs. He wrote (emphasis mine):\nTokenization changes all that. If the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) - the system that underpins trillions of dollars in global transactions every day - is the postal service, tokenization is email itself—assets move directly and instantly, sidestepping intermediaries.\nWhat exactly is tokenization? It’s turning real-world assets—stocks, bonds, real estate—into digital tokens tradable online. Each token certifies your ownership of a specific asset, much like a digital deed. Unlike traditional paper certificates, these tokens live securely on a blockchain, enabling instant buying, selling, and transferring without cumbersome paperwork or waiting periods.\nEvery stock, every bond, every fund—every asset—can be tokenized. If they are, it will revolutionize investing. Markets wouldn’t need to close. Transactions that currently take days would clear in seconds. And billions of dollars currently immobilized by settlement delays could be reinvested immediately back into the economy, generating more growth.\nPerhaps most importantly, tokenization makes investing much more democratic.\nIt can democratize access. Tokenization allows for fractional ownership. That means assets could be sliced into infinitely small pieces. This lowers one of the barriers to investing in valuable, previously inaccessible assets like private real estate and private equity.\nIt can democratize shareholder voting. When you own a stock, you have a right to vote on the company’s shareholder proposals. Tokenization makes that easier because your ownership and voting rights are digitally tracked, allowing you to vote seamlessly and securely from anywhere.\nIt can democratize yield. Some investments produce much higher returns than others, but only big investors can get into them. One reason? Friction. Legal, operational, bureaucratic. Tokenization strips that away, allowing more people access to potentially higher returns.\nOne day, I expect tokenized funds will become as familiar to investors as ETFs—provided we crack one critical problem: identity verification.\nFinancial transactions demand rigorous identity checks. Apple Pay and credit cards handle identity verification effortlessly, billions of times a day. Trade venues like NYSE and MarketAxess manage to do the same for buying and selling securities. But tokenized assets won’t run through those traditional channels, meaning we need a new digital identity verification system. It sounds complex, but India, the world’s most populous country, has already done it. Today, over 90% of Indians can securely verify transactions directly from their smartphones.\nThe takeaway is clear. If we’re serious about building an efficient and accessible financial system, championing tokenization alone won’t suffice. We must solve digital verification, too.\nClearly, tokenization and digital ID are inseparable, as we have reviewed in my previous reports. Digital ID is not just an app on a smartphone; that is the bait & switch. Digital ID is really about your personal credentials (KYC - Know Your Customer) tied to your internet and financial transactions. Tony Blair, former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, is absolutely emphatic about digital ID, so much so that he and his institution call it the “great enabler.”13\n“This great enabler is digital identity. Not just a new piece of identity, but a new system for managing the information we share with government that is suited to the way we live our lives today. It is a digital wallet for every individual that gives them access to their documents (for example, driving license) and control of their data.\n“The new ecosystem should make life easier for people and allow them to use their digital identity in many different contexts – not only to log in to government services but also to access commercial goods and services. This could enable them to prove they have a driving license when renting a car or verify their age online. It should also be accessible to everyone, regardless of whether they own a smartphone.”\nCorroborating with Fink and Blair, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) - created in 1944 as a specialized agency of the United Nations, helping in “furthering international monetary cooperation, encouraging the expansion of trade and economic growth, and discouraging policies that would harm prosperity”14 - publishes a largely unknown magazine called Finance & Development; and in its September edition called “Stablecoins and the Future of Finance,”15 and in it, Prof. Yao Zeng made a shocking admission that reveals that “digital footprints are the new credit scores” from our data harvested by AI.\n“Lending, once the province of bankers and loan officers, increasingly relies on AI and big data. Nonbank fintech platforms use payment records and machine learning to cut search costs, bypass collateral requirements, speed loan approvals, and reach borrowers that traditional banks often overlook. Data, in turn, flows more freely between borrowers and lenders, training increasingly precise and adaptive machines.\n“My research with the Indian Institute of Management’s Pulak Ghosh and Harvard’s Boris Vallee shows how this plays out in India. Small merchants who rely more on cashless payments with detailed and traceable paper trails get better access to working-capital loans. They pay lower interest rates and are less likely to default. In effect, digital footprints are the new credit scores.”\nThis brings us full circle, as we covered in the last edition of Revive The Table, as it was the BIS16 who endorsed a social credit score system embedded in tokens and the token holders themselves in order to enforce “compliance” and modulate “behaviors.”\nIndeed, it is an unholy alliance: President Donald Trump yoking up with big-data harvesters such as Palantir, Oracle, and other big-tech companies to steal our private data and transactions, merged together with the likes of BlackRock, globalist institutions such as the UN, IMF, WEF, and the Federal Reserve and the BIS - Trump and Fink are working in lockstep together to build a digital prison state and a tokenized panopticon to usher in their “golden age,” built upon the ashes of the old system that is being methodically torn apart piece-by-piece in a controlled demolition; where quite literally everything (money, bonds and stocks, real estate, land, food and water, carbon, precious metals, identities, transactions and more) will be reduced to a token to be tracked, traced, programmed and speculated on - thus, fulfilling the WEF’s goal: You will own nothing and be happy.\nAlthough we are not there yet, we are racing towards the eventual ‘final solution:’\nRevelation 13:16 And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads: [17] And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.

But in most cases, doing computer vision implies understanding of the core algorithms, so you can use or adapt them for your own needs.\nI wanted to see how far I could go by stripping computer vision down to the bare minimum: only grayscale 8-bit images, no fancy data structures, plain old C, some byte arrays and a single header file. After all, an image is just a rectangle of numbers, right?\nThis post is a guided tour through the algorithms behind Grayskull – a minimal computer vision library designed for resource-constrained devices.\nPixels\nA grayscale pixel is normally represented as a single byte, where 0\nmeans black, 255\nmeans white, and values in between represent various shades of gray.\nA grayscale image is essentially a 2D array of these pixels, defined by its width and height, but for a simpler memory layout languages such as C often represent it as a 1D array of size width * height\n:\n// An image of WxH pixels, stored as a flat array of bytes\nstruct gs_image { unsigned w, h; uint8_t *data; };\n// Helpers to get/set pixel values respecting the bounds\nuint8_t gs_get(struct gs_image img, unsigned x, unsigned y) {\nreturn (x < img.w && y < img.h) ? img.data[y * img.w + x] : 0;\n}\nvoid gs_set(struct gs_image img, unsigned x, unsigned y, uint8_t value) {\nif (x < img.w && y < img.h) img.data[y * img.w + x] = value;\n}\n// A somewhat convenient macro to iterate over all pixels\n#define gs_for(img, x, y) \\\nfor (unsigned y = 0; y < (img).h; y++) \\\nfor (unsigned x = 0; x < (img).w; x++)\nThis humble start already allows us to do some tricks like inverting or mirroring images:\n// invert image (negative): px[x,y] = 255 - px[x,y]\ngs_for(img, x, y) gs_set(img, x, y, 255 - gs_get(img, x, y));\n// mirror the image: swap px[x,y] with px[w-x-1,y]\ngs_for(img, x, y) {\nfor (unsigned y = 0; y < img.h; y++) {\nfor (unsigned x = 0; x < img.w/2; x++) { // iterate only through the first half\nuint8_t tmp = gs_get(img, x, y);\ngs_set(img, x, y, gs_get(img, img.w - x - 1, y));\ngs_set(img, img.w - x - 1, y, tmp);\n}\n}\nWe can just as well copy images, crop images, resize or rotate them. It’s not computer vision yet, but still some basic image processing:\nstruct gs_rect { unsigned x, y, w, h; }; // for regions of interest (ROI)\n// crop image src into dst using region of interest (roi)\ngs_for(roi, x, y) gs_set(dst, x, y, gs_get(src, roi.x + x, roi.y + y));\n// downscale 2x: set pixel to average from 4 neighbouring pixels (2x2)\ngs_for(dst, x, y) {\nunsigned sum = 0;\nfor (unsigned j = 0; j < 2; j++)\nfor (unsigned i = 0; i < 2; i++)\nsum += gs_get(src, x * 2 + i, y * 2 + j);\ngs_set(dst, x, y, sum / 4);\n}\nOne can do naïve nearest-neighbour resizing, which is fast but looks blocky, or do bilinear interpolation, which is slower and requires floating point operations, but often looks better:\n// Nearest-neighbour resize\nvoid gs_resize_nn(struct gs_image dst, struct gs_image src) {\ngs_for(dst, x, y) {\nunsigned sx = x * src.w / dst.w, sy = y * src.h / dst.h;\ngs_set(dst, x, y, gs_get(src, sx, sy));\n}\n}\n// Bilinear resize\nGS_API void gs_resize(struct gs_image dst, struct gs_image src) {\ngs_for(dst, x, y) {\nfloat sx = ((float)x + 0.5f) * src.w / dst.w, sy = ((float)y + 0.5f) * src.h / dst.h;\nsx = GS_MAX(0.0f, GS_MIN(sx, src.w - 1.0f)), sy = GS_MAX(0.0f, GS_MIN(sy, src.h - 1.0f));\nunsigned sx_int = (unsigned)sx, sy_int = (unsigned)sy;\nunsigned sx1 = GS_MIN(sx_int + 1, src.w - 1), sy1 = GS_MIN(sy_int + 1, src.h - 1);\nfloat dx = sx - sx_int, dy = sy - sy_int;\nuint8_t c00 = gs_get(src, sx_int, sy_int), c01 = gs_get(src, sx1, sy_int),\nc10 = gs_get(src, sx_int, sy1), c11 = gs_get(src, sx1, sy1);\nuint8_t p = (c00 * (1 - dx) * (1 - dy)) + (c01 * dx * (1 - dy)) + (c10 * (1 - dx) * dy) + (c11 * dx * dy);\ngs_set(dst, x, y, p);\n}\n}\nHere’s how the original image (left) looks after bilinear resizing (middle) compared to nearest-neighbour resizing (right).\nImage processing\nNow that we can manipulate individual pixels, we can start doing more serious image processing.\nOne useful tool is convolutional filters. A filter is a small 2D array (kernel) that is applied to each pixel in the image. The new pixel value is computed as a weighted sum of the neighbouring pixels, where weights are defined by the kernel.\nvoid gs_filter(struct gs_image dst, struct gs_image src, struct gs_image kernel, unsigned norm) {\ngs_for(dst, x, y) {\nint sum = 0;\ngs_for(kernel, i, j) {\nsum += gs_get(src, x + i - kernel.w / 2, y + j - kernel.h / 2) * (int8_t)gs_get(kernel, i, j);\n}\ngs_set(dst, x, y, sum / norm);\n}\n}\nThis technique can be used for blurring, sharpening, edge detection and many other effects. Here are some common kernels. Note that they are defined as signed 8-bit integers:\n// box blur 3x3, all pixels have equal weight\nstruct gs_image gs_blur_box = {3, 3, (uint8_t *)(int8_t[]){1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1}};\n// gaussian blur 3x3, central pixels have more weight\nstruct gs_image gs_blur_gaussian = {3, 3, (uint8_t *)(int8_t[]){1, 2, 1, 2, 4, 2, 1, 2, 1}};\n// sharpen, enhance edges\nstruct gs_image gs_sharpen = {3, 3, (uint8_t *)(int8_t[]){0, -1, 0, -1, 5, -1, 0, -1, 0}};\n// emboss, make image look \"3D\"\nstruct gs_image gs_emboss = {3, 3, (uint8_t *)(int8_t[]){-2, -1, 0, -1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 2}};\nSimilarly, we can apply Sobel filters, that are useful if we want to detect edges in the image:\nstruct gs_image gs_sobel_x = {3, 3, (uint8_t *)(int8_t[]){-1, 0, 1, -2, 0, 2, -1, 0, 1}};\nstruct gs_image gs_sobel_y = {3, 3, (uint8_t *)(int8_t[]){1, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0, -1, -2, -1}};\nvoid gs_sobel(struct gs_image dst, struct gs_image src) {\nstruct gs_image gx = {src.w, src.h, malloc(src.w * src.h)};\nstruct gs_image gy = {src.w, src.h, malloc(src.w * src.h)};\ngs_filter(gx, src, gs_sobel_x, 1);\ngs_filter(gy, src, gs_sobel_y, 1);\ngs_for(dst, x, y) {\nint mag = sqrt(gs_get(gx, x, y) * gs_get(gx, x, y) + gs_get(gy, x, y) * gs_get(gy, x, y));\ngs_set(dst, x, y, GS_MIN(mag, 255));\n}\nfree(gx.data);\nfree(gy.data);\n}\nHere are some examples of these filters, notice how some of them remove the noise or enhance the edges:\nThe first image is the original, followed by box filter and Gaussian blur filter. Next is the sharpen filter, then emboss filter and finally Sobel filter that highlights edges.\nThresholding\nTo actually “see” objects in an image, we need to segment it into foreground and background, and then operate on the foreground segments, trying to locate objects of interest.\nThis is much easier done when an image is binary, so that each pixel is either fully black or fully white. This conversion from grayscale to black-and-white is called thresholding.\nIn the simplest case we may consider any pixel above 127 white, and below – black. This is fixed-level thresholding. Of course, in darker environments this thresholding value could be too high and many meaningful details would be lost. So how to pick a threshold value more accurately?\n// apply fixed threshold value and binarise the image\nGS_API void gs_threshold(struct gs_image img, uint8_t thresh) {\nfor (unsigned i = 0; i < img.w * img.h; i++) img.data[i] = (img.data[i] > thresh) ? 255 : 0;\n}\nOne approach would be to calculate the brightness distribution as a histogram. We know that there are 255 unique values of pixels in a grayscale image, so we iterate through all pixels and count how many of them have this or that value. Analysing the resulting histogram could give us some clue about which pixel value would work best as a threshold for the particular image.\nA clever way to do this is with Otsu’s method. It automatically determines the optimal threshold by testing every possible value (from 0 to 255). For each value, it splits the image’s pixels into two classes—background and foreground—and calculates their “inter-class variance.” The threshold that maximizes this variance is the one that creates the best separation between the two classes, making it the ideal choice. It works fiarly well on images with good contrast:\n// try to find the best threshold to separate \"foreground\" from \"background\"\nuint8_t gs_otsu_threshold(struct gs_image img) {\nunsigned hist[256] = {0}, wb = 0, wf = 0, threshold = 0;\n// calculate how many pixels of each brightness value we have\nfor (unsigned i = 0; i < img.w * img.h; i++) hist[img.data[i]]++;\nfloat sum = 0, sumB = 0, varMax = -1.0;\nfor (unsigned i = 0; i < 256; i++) sum += (float)i * hist[i];\n// try to find the threshold that maximises inter-class variance\nfor (unsigned t = 0; t < 256; t++) {\nwb += hist[t];\nif (wb == 0) continue;\nwf = (img.w * img.h) - wb;\nif (wf == 0) break;\nsumB += (float)t * hist[t];\nfloat mB = (float)sumB / wb;\nfloat mF = (float)(sum - sumB) / wf;\nfloat varBetween = (float)wb * (float)wf * (mB - mF) * (mB - mF);\nif (varBetween > varMax) varMax = varBetween, threshold = t;\n}\nreturn threshold;\n}\nIn real life, however, the lighting conditions are often uneven. In such cases a single global threshold may not work well, and neither of the possible 255 threshold values would give a good result.\nTo address this, we can use adaptive thresholding. Instead of using a single threshold for the entire image, we compute a local threshold for each pixel based on the average brightness of its neighbouring pixels. This way, we can better handle varying lighting conditions across the image:\ngs_for(src, x, y) {\nunsigned sum = 0, count = 0;\nfor (int dy = -radius; dy <= (int)radius; dy++) {\nfor (int dx = -radius; dx <= (int)radius; dx++) {\nint sy = (int)y + dy, sx = (int)x + dx;\nif (sy >= 0 && sy < (int)src.h && sx >= 0 && sx < (int)src.w) {\nsum += gs_get(src, sx, sy);\ncount++;\n}\n}\n}\nint threshold = sum / count - c;\ngs_set(dst, x, y, (gs_get(src, x, y) > threshold) ? 255 : 0);\n}\nCompare how various thresholding approaches work on the same image:\nThe first image is the original, followed by fixed-level thresholding (80), then Otsu’s method and adaptive thresholding. Notice how adaptive thresholding preserves more details in both bright and dark areas of the image, while Otsu’s method struggles with uneven lighting.\nMorphological operations\nDue to the way how image sensors work in cameras, images often contain noise.\nThis means that after thresholding there would be random individual pixels that do not belong to any object, or small holes in objects, or small gaps between object parts. All of this will confuse the object detection algorithms, but morphological operations can help to clean up the binary image.\nTwo most common operations are erosion and dilation. Erosion removes pixels on object boundaries (shrinking the objects), while dilation adds pixels to their boundaries (expanding the objects).\nThere is also opening (erosion followed by dilation) and closing (dilation followed by erosion). Opening is useful for removing small objects or noise, while closing is useful for filling small holes in objects.\nvoid gs_erode(struct gs_image dst, struct gs_image src, unsigned radius) {\ngs_for(dst, x, y) {\nuint8_t min_val = 255;\nfor (int dy = -radius; dy <= (int)radius; dy++) {\nfor (int dx = -radius; dx <= (int)radius; dx++) {\nint sy = (int)y + dy, sx = (int)x + dx;\nif (sy >= 0 && sy < (int)src.h && sx >= 0 && sx < (int)src.w) {\nuint8_t val = gs_get(src, sx, sy);\nif (val < min_val) min_val = val;\n}\n}\n}\ngs_set(dst, x, y, min_val);\n}\n}\nvoid gs_dilate(struct gs_image dst, struct gs_image src, unsigned radius) {\ngs_for(dst, x, y) {\nuint8_t max_val = 0;\nfor (int dy = -radius; dy <= (int)radius; dy++) {\nfor (int dx = -radius; dx <= (int)radius; dx++) {\nint sy = (int)y + dy, sx = (int)x + dx;\nif (sy >= 0 && sy < (int)src.h && sx >= 0 && sx < (int)src.w) {\nuint8_t val = gs_get(src, sx, sy);\nif (val > max_val) max_val = val;\n}\n}\n}\ngs_set(dst, x, y, max_val);\n}\n}\nHere’s how morphological operations can clean up a rather confusing image with ArUco markers:\nThe first image is the original, followed by thresholded image (Otsu). Next we do erosion followed by dilation. Since the markers are black it might sound odd, but since morpological operations work on white pixels we essentially perform closing, but for black pixels. We could also invert the image first, then do opening and invert back.\nAt the end all markers are shrinked to their original dimensions and all of them are easily detectable by shape and size.\nBlobs and contours\nOnce we have a clean binary image, we can start detecting objects in it. A classic way to do this is by finding connected components (blobs).\nA “blob” is a group of connected white pixels (255) that form an object. The simplest way to find blobs is by using a flood-fill algorithm or depth-first search (DFS) to label connected pixels:\nvoid gs_flood_fill(struct gs_image img, unsigned x, unsigned y, uint8_t target, uint8_t replacement) {\nif (x >= img.w || y >= img.h) return;\nif (gs_get(img, x, y) != target || gs_get(img, x, y) == replacement) return;\ngs_set(img, x, y, replacement);\ngs_flood_fill(img, x + 1, y, target, replacement);\ngs_flood_fill(img, x - 1, y, target, replacement);\ngs_flood_fill(img, x, y + 1, target, replacement);\ngs_flood_fill(img, x, y - 1, target, replacement);\n}\nOf course this would immediately blow up your stack on most real-life images. So an iterative approach using a queue or stack is preferred.\nHowever, it’s still a fairly suboptimal way to find blobs. A more efficient approach is a two-pass algorithm, which scans the image twice: first to assign “provisional” labels and record equivalences between them, followed by the second scan to resolve these equivalences and assign final unique labels to every blob.\nIt would be nice if we could use the same gs_image\ntype for labels, but in most cases it would require more than 256 labels (especially for temporary provisional labels). So we need a separate array of larger integers to store labels:\ntypedef uint16_t gs_label; // 64K should be enough, right?\nstruct gs_blob {\ngs_label label; // what label the blob has?\nunsigned area; // how many white pixels are in a blob?\nstruct gs_rect box; // bounding box\nstruct gs_point centroid; // center of \"mass\"\n};\nunsigned gs_blobs(struct gs_image img, gs_label *labels, struct gs_blob *blobs, unsigned nblobs) { ... }\nBefore we go futher, let’s talk about connectivity. There are two common types of pixel connectivity: 4-connectivity and 8-connectivity. In 4-connectivity, a pixel is connected to its four direct neighbours (up, down, left, right). In 8-connectivity, a pixel is connected to all eight surrounding pixels (including diagonals). So, in case of 8-connectivity this would be one blob and in case of 4-connectivity - two separate blobs:\n......\n.#..#.\n.##.#.\n.###..\n......\nWe will be using 4-connectivity in our implementation, for simplicity. Let’s consider the following image:\n.........\n.###..#..\n.###.##..\n.#####..#\n.......##\nWe start scanning it row after row, if a white pixel is found, we check its left and top neighbours:\n- If both are black (0), we assign a new label to the pixel, assuming that it could be a new blob.\n- If one of them is white, we assign its label to the current pixel, as it is a continuation of the existing known blob.\n- If both are white but have different labels, we assign the smallest of the labels to the current pixel and record the equivalence between the two labels in a special data structure (like a union-find).\nAfter this first pass the labels array would look like this:\n.........\n.111..2..\n.111.32..\n.11111..4\n.......55\nOur equivalence table would look like this: 1 <-> 3, 3 <-> 2, 4 <-> 5\n.\nDuring the second pass we resolve the equivalences and assign final labels to each pixel. The final labels array would look like this:\n.........\n.111..1..\n.111.11..\n.11111..4\n.......44\nDuring the second pass we can also calculate blob properties, such as area, bounding box and centroid. Largest blob’s area is 14 pixels, bounding box is from (1,1) to (6,3). Centroid is calculated as the average of all pixel coordinates in the blob, in our case for X it would be (3*1+3*2+3*3+4+2*5+2*6)/14\n, or rounded to 4. Y coordinate would be (4*1+5*2+5*3)/14\n, or rounded to 2. So the centroid is (4,2), which is not part of the blob “body”, but still is the center of mass.\nSuch geometric properties already give us plenty of information about blobs. For example, we can filter blobs by area to remove small noise blobs. We can also calculate aspect ratio (width/height) of the bounding box to filter out very tall or very wide blobs. Ratio between blob actual area and bounding box area helps to filter out blobs that are not compact enough. Rectangles tend to have a ratio of 1.0\n, circles are pi/4 = 0.785\n, while lines approach to zero.\nAnother clues could be centroid position, orientation using moments or contour shape. There is a fairly simple method to trace a contour of a blob using the Moore-Neighbor tracing algorithm. It starts from a known border pixel and follows the contour clockwise by checking neighbouring pixels, until it returns to the starting pixel:\nstruct gs_contour { struct gs_rect box; struct gs_point start; unsigned length; };\nvoid gs_trace_contour(struct gs_image img, struct gs_image visited, struct gs_contour *c) {\nstatic const int dx[] = {1, 1, 0, -1, -1, -1, 0, 1};\nstatic const int dy[] = {0, 1, 1, 1, 0, -1, -1, -1};\nc->length = 0;\nc->box = (struct gs_rect){c->start.x, c->start.y, 1, 1};\nstruct gs_point p = c->start;\nunsigned dir = 7, seenstart = 0;\nfor (;;) {\nif (!visited.data[p.y * visited.w + p.x]) c->length++;\nvisited.data[p.y * visited.w + p.x] = 255;\nint ndir = (dir + 1) % 8, found = 0;\nfor (int i = 0; i < 8; i++) {\nint d = (ndir + i) % 8, nx = p.x + dx[d], ny = p.y + dy[d];\nif (nx >= 0 && nx < (int)img.w && ny >= 0 && ny < (int)img.h &&\nimg.data[ny * img.w + nx] > 128) {\np = (struct gs_point){nx, ny};\ndir = (d + 6) % 8;\nfound = 1;\nbreak;\n}\n}\nif (!found) break; // open contour\nc->box.x = GS_MIN(c->box.x, p.x);\nc->box.y = GS_MIN(c->box.y, p.y);\nc->box.w = GS_MAX(c->box.w, p.x - c->box.x + 1);\nc->box.h = GS_MAX(c->box.h, p.y - c->box.y + 1);\nif (p.x == c->start.x && p.y == c->start.y) {\nif (seenstart) break;\nseenstart = 1;\n}\n}\n}\nThis way we can extract contours for each blob and analyse their shapes or compare contour length (perimeter) to the blob area. It is also possible to approximate contours with straight lines using Douglas-Peucker algirithm, which replaces a curve with a series of straight line segments, while preserving the overall shape.\nAll of this is good if we want to detect simple objects in a static image. But what if we want to detect or track more complex objects, like faces, cars or pedestrians?\nKeypoints and descriptors\nA keypoint is a specific location in an image that is distinctive and can be reliably detected no matter what scale, rotation or lighting of the object are.\nIn practice, keypoints are often corners (also known as “features”). One of the most intuitive algorithms to detect features is FAST (Features from Accelerated Segment Test). It works by examining a circle of 16 pixels around a candidate pixel (4 pixels away from it). If at least 9 of contiguous pixels in this r=4px\ncircle around pixel P\nare all brighter or all darker - then the candidate pixel is considered a corner:\n..............\n......012.....\n.....F...3....\n....E.....4...\n....D..P..5...\n....C.....6...\n.....B...7....\n......A98.....\n..............\nAs simple as it gets, this approach finds too many features in real-life images. A solution is to keep “score” of each feature and only keep the points with the highest score. The score can be calculated as the sum of absolute differences between the candidate pixel and the contiguous pixels in the circle, or by the minimum difference between central pixel and the pixels on the circle.\ngs_assert(gs_valid(img) && kps && nkps > 0);\nstatic const int dx[16] = {0, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 2, 1, 0, -1, -2, -3, -3, -3, -2, -1};\nstatic const int dy[16] = {-3, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 2, 1, 0, -1, -2, -3};\nunsigned n = 0;\n// first pass: compute score map\nfor (unsigned y = 3; y < img.h - 3; y++) {\nfor (unsigned x = 3; x < img.w - 3; x++) {\nuint8_t p = img.data[y * img.w + x];\nint run = 0, score = 0;\nfor (int i = 0; i < 16 + 9; i++) {\nint idx = (i % 16);\nuint8_t v = img.data[(y + dy[idx]) * img.w + (x + dx[idx])];\nif (v > p + threshold) {\nrun = (run > 0) ? run + 1 : 1;\n} else if (v < p - threshold) {\nrun = (run < 0) ? run - 1 : -1;\n} else {\nrun = 0;\n}\nif (run >= 9 || run <= -9) {\nscore = 255;\nfor (int j = 0; j < 16; j++) {\nint d = gs_get(img, x + dx[j], y + dy[j]) - p;\nif (d < 0) d = -d;\nif (d < score) score = d;\n}\nbreak;\n}\n}\nscoremap.data[y * img.w + x] = score;\n}\n}\n// second pass: non-maximum suppression\nfor (unsigned y = 3; y < img.h - 3; y++) {\nfor (unsigned x = 3; x < img.w - 3; x++) {\nint s = scoremap.data[y * img.w + x], is_max = 1;\nif (s == 0) continue;\nfor (int yy = -1; yy <= 1 && is_max; yy++) {\nfor (int xx = -1; xx <= 1; xx++) {\nif (xx == 0 && yy == 0) continue;\nif (scoremap.data[(y + yy) * img.w + (x + xx)] > s) {\nis_max = 0;\nbreak;\n}\n}\n}\nif (is_max && n < nkps) kps[n++] = (struct gs_keypoint){{x, y}, (unsigned)s, 0, {0}};\n}\n}\nreturn n;\n}\nNotice how keypoints are detected on corners and distinctive features of the cat image, such as eyes, nose, whiskers and other “meaningful” corners. But how to use keypoints to detect objects?\nThis is where ORB enters the stage. ORB builds on top of the same FAST corner detector, it tries to find sharp intensity changes, but also adds two more components: orientation and descriptor.\nOnce the corners are found, ORB estimates their orientation by calculating image moments in a small patch around each keypoint. This way, each keypoint gets an angle, basically saying which way is “up” for this keypoint.\nThen comes the descriptor. A descriptor is a compact representation of the local image patch around the keypoint, designed to be invariant to scale and rotation. ORB uses a modified version of BRIEF (Binary Robust Independent Elementary Features) descriptor, which is a clever way to encode image patch as a small bit string.\nIt simply compares bit intensities, if one pixel is lighter than another, it sets the corresponding bit to 1\n, otherwise to 0\n. By performing multiple such comparisons, we can create a binary string that represents the local image patch.\nThe descriptor is 256 bit long, and for each of the 256 “samples” we pick two sampling points within the patch area using some pseudo-random lookup table and encode the following bit as 0 or 1 depending on the pixel relative values.\nComparing keypoints becomes trivial, we simply XOR two bitstrings and count the bits.\nSince keypoints are agnostic to rotation and lighting conditions, we can use them to detect objects in various scenarios.\nOne last addition to this algorithm is to resize/scale the image multiple times and detect keypoints at different scales. This way we can detect objects that are closer or further away from the camera, rotated at any angle, or partially occluded.\nLBP Cascades\nWhile keypoints and descriptors are great for detecting arbitrary objects, sometimes we need a more specialised approach for specific object types, like faces, vehicles, or hand gestures. This is where cascade classifiers, famously used in the Viola-Jones object detection framework, come into play.\nInstead of complex Haar-like features used by Viola and Jones, we can use something simpler: Local Binary Patterns (LBP). LBP is a powerful texture descriptor. For each pixel, it looks at its 8 neighbours. If a neighbour is brighter than the central pixel, we write a ‘1’, otherwise a ‘0’. This gives us an 8-bit number that describes the local texture.\nThe “cascade” is a series of simple classifiers, or “stages”. Each stage looks at a sub-window of the image and uses a few LBP features to decide if that window could possibly contain the object of interest (e.g., a face).\n- If the sub-window fails the test at any stage, it’s immediately rejected. This is very fast.\n- Only if a sub-window passes all stages is it classified as a positive detection.\nThis structure allows the classifier to quickly discard the vast majority of the image, focusing computational power only on promising regions. By sliding this detection window across the entire image (and across multiple scales), we can find objects of a specific, pre-trained class. Grayskull provides a pre-trained frontal face detector that uses this exact technique.\nHere you can see the LBP cascade classifier in action, successfully detecting Sir Gary Oldman in all variety of his faces. The picture on the left uses minimum number of neighbours set to 4, while the right one uses 14. This means the left image detects more faces, but also has more false positives, while the right one is more conservative and only detect camera-facing images with no visual obstructions.\nConclusion\nWe’ve taken a journey from the humble pixel to sophisticated object detection, all using simple C structures and fundamental algorithms. We tried to manipulate pixels, apply filters to enhance images, segment objects using thresholding, and clean them up. We then learned to find and analyze blobs, detect robust keypoints with FAST and ORB, and finally, use LBP cascades for specialized object detection.\nThis is the core philosophy of Grayskull: to demystify computer vision by providing a minimal, dependency-free, and understandable toolkit. It proves that you don’t always need massive libraries or deep learning frameworks to achieve decent results, especially on resource-constrained systems.\nAn image is indeed just a rectangle of numbers, and with a bit of algorithmic knowledge, you have the power to make it see. As always, I encourage you to check out the repository, experiment with the code, and maybe even try building your own simple CV project!\nI hope you’ve enjoyed this article.

Most people complaining about what I did happen to have “devops”, “cloud engineer”, “serverless guy”, “AWS certified”, or something similar in their bio.\nNone of these people have any skin in the game.\nThey don’t run their own projects in the cloud, they don’t pay a single dollar of the cloud bill at the end of the month, and they couldn’t care less about their employer’s AWS bill. They don’t feel the pain of being scammed out of thousands and thousands of dollars by cloud providers month after month. With someone else’s money, everyone’s brave.\nTo them, it’s way too convenient to be on AWS: not only it solves their problem, but it’s also a shiny object. It’s technically complex, it makes them look smart in front of other devs, it creates dependencies and lock-in effects so they’re not easily replaceable as employees, and most importantly – being on the cloud yields them a fat paycheck at the end of the month. They don’t have any incentive to make the most efficient decision for the business they work for, on the contrary – they depend on the business’ infrastructure being as complex and convoluted as possible, or they’ll be out of a job.\nSo don’t count on any of them telling you the truth – the truth that servers are not actually expensive.\nYou can just rent servers for cheap\nI made my move from AWS to a company called Hetzner. I don’t get paid by them or have any affiliation to them, they just happen to offer cheap servers. I’ve used Digital Ocean in the past, loved them and considered them this time, but Hetzner prices are just better.\nHow good are the prices? Well, let’s take a look:\nYou can rent bare-metal servers with 80 cores for under $190 a month. I repeat: eighty cores for one-hundred-ninety dollars a month.\nFor comparison, compute-heavy instances in AWS of the C5-C6 families with comparable number of vCPUs cost between $2,500 and $3,500 a month – which is between 13x and 18x more expensive. Sure, you can get reserved instances, and that brings the price down to ~$1,300/mo, which is still 7x more expensive, plus you’d need to pay $46k upfront and be locked to a 3-year contract. I don’t know, Rick…\nSay you don’t need such a big server. You don’t need, or you don’t want, to pay for the 79EUR one-time setup fee. It’s understandable, you only want to run your little projects, or you want a bit more flexibility. Let’s look at the VPS options:\nYou still can get a 48-vCPU machine for around $300/mo, without setup fees, without 3-year contracts, and with full flexibility to scale it down if needed.\nOr a more-than-enough 8-core, 32GB RAM machine for around $50 a month that will probably be able to run all your projects at once, as long as they’re not getting literal millions of requests per day.\nYou can buy servers for even cheaper\nBut say this is still not cheap enough for you.\nYou’re not worried about monthly costs, you’re looking to save for the long run. Well, turns out buying your own servers is even cheaper in a long enough time frame:\nYou can buy a decent rack-mounted server, with 44 CPUs, 256GB RAM, 2TB NVMe SSD and a bunch of other features for under $1k. Think about it. You could probably run your app for years – for less than what you probably pay a month in cloud services.\nNow, of course, you can buy the server but you still to account for the electricity costs, internet costs, cooling costs, rack costs, etc. I’m not going to get to that level of detail. The bottom line is that good servers are cheap.\nYou can also choose to rent rack space in a datacenter, and they’ll provide you with reliable electricity, internet, cooling, security, etc. You can look for datacenters in your area using websites like DatacenterMap:\nThe way it works is: you call the datacenter and they provide you with either shared space or a whole secure room for your servers, called datacenter cage, like this one:\nAnd then you buy and ship your racks, and switches, and cables, and servers to the datacenter, load all the boxes in a little warehouse cart, transport everything into your cage and start building the racks and putting your servers in them:\nBUT – all of this is WAY too complex for small developers. You’d probably need to hire an engineer to help you set everything right, you’d need to be in sales calls with the datacenter to negotiate the price and all that – it’s way too cumbersome. Not worth it.\nI’m just documenting it so you get a notion of how things actually work. I’ve never done this myself, it’s usually aimed at medium-to-big companies and enterprises that want to build their own infrastructure, and it’s pretty unusual that small teams do this.\nDatacenter operations are quite interesting, I recommend you go watch some videos to get a better understanding of how the internet actually works. This is literally how AWS works under the hood. It’s all datacenters. The whole internet is just cold, noisy rooms filled with metal boxes. Always has been.\nNow, instead of renting an entire datacenter cage, you can just rent some available rack space in a shared rack, and then place your server there.\nBut you’d still need to physically go and install your server – and the end result is in practice THE SAME as just renting an already mounted server off a company like Hetzner, as I already described. And Hetzner takes care of replacing server parts when they go faulty, and they take all that hardware weight off your shoulders, quite literally.\nbUt ISn’T tHat sTilL tHe clOUD\nOne of the most common critiques I got while I was trying to make the points above was something along the lines of: “but isn’t that still the cloud?”, “you didn’t actually exit the cloud, you just changed cloud providers”\nLook, first of all, you’re as unique as the other 1000 peanut gallery enjoyers that have made the same astute observation before you. Congratulations. But you’re absolutely missing the point.\nThe point here is that there’s value in managing your own servers VS just accepting the cloud as a given truth. The point is you can start paying 10x-100x less money by running a little Linux machine instead of using managed AWS services. The point is most developers are scared of servers, and they just need a little push and encouragement to realize they can just set up their own servers for cheap to replace money-burners like RDS. The point is almost no one in the real world needs the cloud’s expensive managed services, and can do just fine with regular software running on a couple Linux boxes.\nAt the end of the day, the only hard truth is whether you managed to keep more dollars in your pocket or you gave them away to Amazon’s stockholders’ pockets.\nThe whole debate of “is this still the cloud or not” is nonsense to me. You’re just getting lost in naming conventions. VPS, bare metal, on-prem, colo, who cares what you call it. You need to put your servers somewhere. Sure, have a computer running in your mom’s basement if that makes you feel like you’re exiting the cloud more, I’ll have mine in a datacenter and both will be happy.\nI don’t care if the server is physically in my building. I don’t need to touch it, I need to ssh\ninto it. In fact, if I had bought a physical server instead of renting one off Hetzner, I would still need to rent rack space to host it. At which point, you’re just doing the exact same thing as renting a server off Hetzner, only more expensive and less convenient if you’re a small developer.\nIt seems to me that people pushing for the “this is still the cloud” mindset are essentially gatekeepers. “You’re not doing it correctly, you need to purchase your own switches, build your own rack, hook the ethernet cable yourself…” – boss, how far do you wanna take this argument? Do you etch your own circuits too? This whole thing is like saying “I’m the only one who knows how to do it right and you’re not puritan enough to belong in this exclusive club”. It’s not only toxic, but it’s also the most lazy argumentation one could make. It’s choosing to get nuclear over a superficial nuance, instead of trying to refute the central argument.\nThe central argument is servers are not actually expensive, and whoever is telling you otherwise is probably trying to sell you a cloud managed service.\nCompanies like AWS or Vercel are charging you a 10x to 100x markup.\nYou’re not using the cloud wrong, it’s just expensive\nThey will try to gaslight you.\nThey will not only try to convince you you’re not exiting the cloud, but they’ll go as far as gaslighting you. They will make you believe you were not smart enough to get the cloud.\n“You’re using the cloud wrong”, “It’s expensive because you’re doing it poorly”, “You just need to know how to use the cloud”.\nYou will hear a bunch of crap from people that have literally never tried the alternative. People with no real hands-on experience managing servers for their own projects for any sustained period of time. People trying to offer expert-level advice but that end up just spewing out generic, bland, off-the-shelve clichés and vague notions about how they think the cloud should work. People not only without skin in the game, but whose first job was straight into the cloud. People that go literally silent when you ask them: “so, what have you personally built lately, how many users does it serve, and how much are you paying for it?” They just don’t know better, and they’ll try to save face by defending themselves like a cat with its back against the wall – even if that means gaslighting you.\nI’m definitely not an expert but I know my way around AWS. Hell, I’ve even studied AWS certs. I made sure my infra was not overprovisioned. I made sure I was not paying for services I was not using in regions I might have used only once or twice. I had already spent countless hours optimizing AWS costs, and even had some success in doing so (I even managed to cut my monthly AWS bill in more than half last year – it was north of $5k/mo before!)\nI already did all that. I do know about serverless computing. I do know about reserved instances. I had reserved instances, in fact. (Don’t purchase reserved instances, they only make the problem worse: they create vendor lock-in, and they essentially go against everything I’ve been trying to argue. The least thing you want when you’re considering getting off the cloud because it keeps getting more and more expensive is to lock yourself into it with a 3-year contract. Yes, I also do know you can resell RIs, thanks, my argument still stands).\nI tried all that, I tried as hard as I could, and the only conclusion I arrived to after many, many frustrations was that the cloud is simply way too expensive.\nYou can try yourself, by all means be my guest and try to prove me wrong, but I’ve already been there, done that, and I’m pretty sure of what I’m saying. So I’d suggest you just don’t listen to the fearmongering cloud cult folks that keep repeating gaslighting mantras like a broken record.\nYou won’t make friends proposing all this\nAll this backlash was interesting. Why do all these people care if I save more money or not?\nI arrived at two main conclusions: 1) their livelihood depends on it; and 2) because of this fear, the conversation turns irrational.\nOne – their livelihoods depend on it.\nIf they’re wrong, and if I and more people like me manage to convince enough people that they’re wrong, they may be out of a job soon.\nIt’s as simple as that.\nWe come from a decade-long trend where the cool thing was to build things in the cloud, which in turn created thousands if not millions of “devops” and “cloud engineers”; and we’re now switching to a trend where the cool thing is to keep things off the cloud, which may terminate the careers of many cloud experts. It’s just another cycle, but people get understandably very defensive about it.\nI’m sure many developers secretly know the cloud is not as good as they initially promised, and they hold that conflicting thought in their head day in and day out as they go about their job. There’s just no way those bright engineers look at their employer’s AWS spending realizing it’s 10x what it should be and go like: “ah, this is fine”.\nBut no one wants to do the work, and risk getting their managers upset and getting thrown under the bus. They don’t want to risk the political cost of not being in the same page as the most vocal person in the team. Or they just don’t know better. Many entered the industry after the cloud was already mainstream. People used to run their own servers, it used to be absolutely normal and just the thing to do, but Amazon’s marketing team managed to flip the market, so newcomers haven’t touched anything but cloud in their entire careers – and AWS evangelists convinced whoever seniors were left.\nTwo – it’s not a rational discussion. As a result, developers that are currently balls deep into this whole cloud thing have developed some sort of Stockholm syndrome about the cloud. It’s essentially sunk cost fallacy, but it turns them into very irrational creatures.\nAWS has a strong cult-like following. They teach you the doctrine via certifications where they make you memorize actual sales pages and product offerings, they have literal evangelists, they instruct you to stop listening to the rational voices around you that push for pragmatism instead of dogmatism, they instill fear of the outside world in you (servers are dangerous! things don’t scale!), they make you adopt “cloud engineer” as your whole new identity, they make it really easy to get in but really difficult to get out, etc. I’m not saying it’s an actual cult, of course, just that things get irrational pretty quick. More so when people’s livelihoods are on the line.\nThe end result is AWS followers, whenever confronted, get caught up in dogma and just start throwing irrational arguments left and right, repeating the AWS sales landing pages’ talking points one by one, and don’t even stop to think about what they really need or if those things are even of use to them. They got tricked into believing something, and once you touch upon belief systems, people get irrational.\nI could never win this irrational discussion with rational arguments. It doesn’t matter how good my optimizations were. I could have cut costs 100x instead of just 10x – or I could have claimed something outrageous like I got to run all my infrastructure for just $1. It just doesn’t matter.\nThese people would still be ranting and arguing that I’m doomed because now I don’t have things like “infinite scalability capabilities” or “automated failovers with automated replica recovery”. These are things that I’ve never needed or used, things that I’m sure 99% of people in the thread never needed or used either, but that they throw at you in a vain attempt to build an argument.\nWhen people are cornered, arguments quickly turn into dogma – and fear:\nHackers will break in. Your servers will get full of malware. Your hardware will fail and you won’t be able to restore it. Your switches will break and your customers will leave while your server is down. You will need to pay someone to maintain and upgrade your server, there’s no way around it! And you need a plethora of busywork to “do it properly”: failure scenarios! Recovery plans! Managing availability! Infosec! Monsters, spiders and zombies! All of them, coming for you! Be afraid, very afraid! How dare you not be afraid of all this scary stuff!\nWell, either the last 15 years of my life –and the lives of most webmasters on the internet– have been a lie, or you don’t actually need any of that to run a server online.\nHow did we get here?\nThe majority of devs are clueless, or have forgotten, about how we got here.\nEveryone used to run their own servers. Either VPSs, or hosting services, or bare metal in datacenters, or in a dark room in their companies, or at home. Everyone was familiar and comfortable ssh\ning into machines.\nI remember very clearly how the cloud marketing psyops campaign started in the early 2010s. It was a deliberate move by companies to try to shill their enterprise technology to early-stage startups, trying to get them locked in as early as possible so they could milk them as they raised rounds.\nI remember when AWS started to give out credits specifically for startups only. They would literally make the rounds, going from startup accelerator to startup accelerator, trying to get everyone on board.\nThe trick is easy: you make it extremely cheap (free!) for startups to build on your infrastructure, then make everything extremely expensive as they grow, and enjoy the show because they’re so locked in most will struggle to escape the ecosystem by them.\nAWS was not the only one. I remember attending an IBM cloud event in 2014. I was the CTO of a small startup at the time. They were very specifically targeting startups; in fact, we got the invitation via our startup accelerator.\nWe ran everything on Heroku at the time, and it worked just fine. I remember thinking: “what the hell is all this cloud stuff and how do I use it?” I vividly remember feeling like they were trying to sell us something that was not designed for us. I spent some time looking into it and just couldn’t wrap my head around this whole cloud thing. All of it sounded so alien to us.\nBut all these companies poured literal millions upon millions of dollars into this cloud shilling campaign over the following years, tricking early startups into adopting enterprise technology.\nThey ended up being successful at it – and the aftermath is the current state of web development in 2024. Zero interest rates through most of the last decade definitely helped in getting us here.\nThere is now a counterculture movement, mainly led by @dhh and the Rails community, and this feels like something fundamentally fresh, right, and aligned with the reality of MOST software businesses on Earth.\nYou don’t need the cloud\nSome people are absolutely out of touch with what most software businesses look like in the real world.\nThey think in terms of Fortune 500; they truly believe enterprise is the norm. They think the average business needs all the bells and whistles the cloud has to offer: high availability, multi-zone replication, automatic failovers, distributed Kubernetes clusters…\nThe reality is only a teeny tiny fraction of all software businesses need something like this.\nMost businesses are and will always be small, by a simple rule of power law.\nMost business are small, and the ones that need actual computing power can do incredibly well without the cloud up until a very high point. Scaling vertically can get you very, very far nowadays.\nMost devs wildly overestimate scaling requirements. They have such a low bar for what “high traffic” means.\nHere’s a reference point: my current two-server setup serves millions of requests a day for millions of monthly visitors. So is the case for many other indie makers, like @levelsio, who even managed to get everything down to one single server. Most devs have never tried running a project of their own, with actual users and actual production traffic, on a single server – and it shows.\nDevs also wildly overestimate other technical requirements. Again, only a tiny fraction of software businesses need the bells and whistles. Of course they exist, but they’re rare, and they usually have very good reasons for their technical decisions.\nLike Netflix, needing to transcode and stream enormous amounts of video to customers all over the world. That’s where you need distributed systems, CDNs, edge computing, all of that stuff. Your little app with one thousand users that just sends some JSON objects around does definitely not need that.\nI feel like most devs have this magical notion in their heads that their project is something like Netflix. It’s wishful thinking, and I get it – you want to be as successful as Netflix. But it makes you make the wrong technical decisions, and all of a sudden they think they need to have distributed servers all over the world because their users will somehow notice a few milliseconds difference in latency when they tap a button. It’s wild.\nI remember a random conversation I had with a young entrepreneur a couple years ago. He ran a mobile app. I don’t remember what exactly it did, but it was of the “upload things and follow people” category of apps. I asked: “what’s the biggest challenge your facing in your startup?”, and he replied: “well, that’d be estimating monthly AWS costs. They’re high and unpredictable”. I held my breath and took a step back, as one does when someone makes a claim bold enough to make you reconsider if you might be in front of a billionaire or a super-successful entrepreneur you’ve never heard about, and respectfully asked: “how many users does your app have?”. “Oh, about a thousand now” – he replied.\nBro, just get a server. You don’t need the cloud.\nYour servers are going to be okay\nSomething I discovered is that a lot of people have magical ideas about how datacenters actually work.\nThey think servers in datacenters are fragile and volatile. Like things that can just vanish into thin air.\nSomeone even thought a lightning strike can take down an entire datacenter and nuke your business out of existence.\nThe reality is modern datacenters already account for all these problems and are equipped with many protections: not only against things as mundane as lightning, but against pretty much anything that can compromise uptime.\nThey have plenty of redundant systems: redundant power sources, redundant cooling, redundant internet connections, redundant fire suppresion systems, redundant security sustems and tons of physical security… Everything in a datacenter is designed with resiliency and redundancy in mind (N+1 redundancy at minimum, sometimes 2N) to guarantee uptime.\nThese are mostly fear-driven opinions, the result of a successful cloud marketing and psyops campaign. Where do you think AWS stores their machines, in a magical place under the rainbow? And how exactly would AWS machines be the only ones magically protected against problems that other datacenters also have?\nDisasters can happen (OVH 2021), sure, and you should have backups to recover from them – but in my experience of ~15 years running servers I think they’re rare, and I’ve never had any downtime of more than a few minutes.\nYour server is probably going to be okay.\nYou won’t have to spend your days managing servers\nAnyone who has managed servers for long enough knows you spend most time in the initial setup; then servers tend to be relatively stable.\nHardware failures are relatively rare, and once a server is up and running it usually runs flawlessly for years without much intervention.\nManaging your own servers is not a full-time job.\nYou don’t need to employ a 5-person devops team. You don’t even need to hire a server guy: you can just do things yourself! It’s not that difficult.\nClaude and ChatGPT usually have a good understanding of Linux systems and how to manage them, ask them for help.\nWhen I posted the tweet, people thought this was my first time running servers and claimed I was overly optimistic in what running a server actually means.\nIt’s difficult to say these things without coming across as arrogant, but I’ve been managing servers since 2006.\nI started, as many did, editing PHP scripts and uploading them to my FTP server. I first had to learn how to install WordPress, then ventured a bit and started editing WP templates, then everything else followed.\nIt was an invaluable experience for me. It taught me the basics.\nIt taught me what Linux was, how to navigate it, and by 2007 I was requesting Canonical for Ubuntu CD-ROMs that would arrive in the mail and that I would use to install in a partition in my parents’ computer to learn more about Linux.\nThose early experiences taught me the basics of web development; everything else is built on top of it. Which leads me to my next point:\nYou will learn how to use Linux, and that’s a good thing\nI think the new generations of devs (genz devs, alpha devs, etc.) are absolutely out of touch with the hardware that runs their software.\nThey lack these kinds of foundational experiences.\nThey were born in an era where a random guy on Youtube shilled them one specific vendor and taught them to run one very specific command that magically solved all their infrastructure problems. It’s only reasonable they have magical assumptions about what servers are and how they work.\nThey rant and rant about how you can just do things “serverless” without realizing they’re just running their code in many different boxes. Of course, many of them go on to learn more about Linux and servers, but the average bootcamp grad, let’s say, lacks the hands-on Linux experience that FTP hackers would have had 20 years ago.\nI’m not making moral judgements about this: I’m not arguing it’s good or bad – it is what it is. The current state of web dev.\nBut the result is companies like Vercel are making literal millions of dollars by capitalizing on this new generation of developers that generally don’t know what they’re doing and have never ran a server of their own in their life.\nVercel pricing is absolutely insane, it blows my mind\n— Daniel Lockyer (@DanielLockyer) October 3, 2024\nData transfer starts at $150/TB with 1TB included\nHetzner gives 20TB free, and then it’s €1.19/TB\nSo 20TB on Vercel is $2850, on Hetzner it’s free (included with VPS)\nAnd then you have to pay extra per request?\nPerhaps…\nIgnorance has a double price: being ignorant in itself; and the price you pay for people exploiting that ignorance of yours. Not knowing how things work will actually cost you money.\nYou’ll be fine\nEven if you’ve never managed your own server and you’re scared of everything that smells of backend, you’ll be fine.\nIn fact, there has never been a better time to get good at servers. Claude and ChatGPT are both extremely knowledgeable about Linux, and can guide your steps like it’s never been possible before in the history of technology. Not only to set things up and understand how they work, but whenever you need to make a change you can just ask them, and follow the steps without needing to hire anyone. It’s not as scary as it seems, and you won’t have to do it that often.\nPlus, in the time of AI where code generation is the norm and code might even become a commodity, knowing how to put that code in cheap production servers, and make it actually useful to end users might be a key differentiator for you as a developer.\nYou will now need to worry about things like security, sure. Don’t listen to those arguing that running your own server is somehow less secure than running AWS’s servers, as if EC2 instances were magically protected against hackers or something.\nThe reality is it’s not that difficult to set things up right, just follow my guide and setup scripts for example. There are many devs, more experienced than you, doing things in production way worse than what you could do when equiped with AI. Ask ChatGPT how to harden your Linux server and follow best security practices (like: don’t use password auth, only strong ssh keys) and you’re 90% there. Just take the plunge and go for it.\nSomething like Cloudflare can get you really far, too.\nAfter locking your Linux box you can run Cloudflare on top of everything for an extra layer of protection: proxy the IP of your server on their DNS so you don’t expose it and you’re golden. And you get DDoS protection, edge caching, and a top-tier DNS for essentially free.\nYou’ll be fine.\nP.S.: Follow me on Twitter to stay in the loop.

Solok, West Sumatra\nThis post is dedicated to Pak Budahar - a real Minang musical legend who literally spread music across Sumatra, providing sweet solace to his passengers for decades. Next time you honk your horn, I hope you think of him.\n+++\nWhat was the last time you honked your car horn? If it wasn’t a precautionary toot, it was surely out of frustration, if not outright anger. The honk is a scream from within our sealed-in vehicles - “Take heed! There’s a human in here!” But have you ever honked with tenderness, with love, with longing? The tukang kalason of West Sumatra have.\nThe Minangkabau people of this region are famous for their tradition of marantau, immigrating far and wide in search of a better life (often opening nasi Padang spots wherever they go!) Back in the 1950s, buses journeyed overland carrying migrants from West Sumatra to ports across this massive island - Medan, Pekanbaru, Bengkulu. This was an emotional journey: as they left their village, they looked onward to their future life with trepidation, then looked behind with longing at the home and family they were leaving behind. As the bus climbed the mountains and away, the tukang kalason would play the sweet sounds of home on his musical horn.\nSome genius Minangkabau mechanic had armed the buses with a remarkable tool: a kalason oto (literally “car horn”, from the Dutch claxon) which didn’t just toot but sang! After Indonesia’s independence in 1945, American car manufacturers like Chevrolet began importing buses to Sumatra. Under the hood were car horns typical of the time: a few metal or plastic trumpets (trompet or corong) with reeds that would sound out a phrase (what Indonesians fondly call telolet!) when air was sucked through them via the carburetor. A mechanic in the highland town of Bukittinggi collected spare horns and had the bright idea of tuning and arranging them in a musical scale, then routing them to a typewriter-like keyboard (kontak or tuts) beside the steering wheel for the driver to play.\nAt first, these kalason had eight notes - just enough for an octave in the more or less diatonic scale used for playing the sweet, ornament-rich melodies of Minangkabau folk music. As this new feature caught on, though, it was developed even further, with 14 notes becoming common, even up to 24, providing even more flexibility for the driver who would often sing along - multiple octaves allowed them to find a tune that fit their range! Left hand on the steering wheel, right hand on the kontak, the drivers pioneered a one-handed playing style that combined the inflected melodies of Minang music (especially those of saluang flute music and rabab fiddle) with rhythmic accents and chords (garitiak - like a musical garnish*) perhaps borrowed from the harmonium and accordion sounds of hybrid Sumatran musical genres like gamat and orkes Melayu.\n+++\nIt was 1960, and Pak Budahar was just 11 years old when his older brother started driving for one of these Bukittinggi bus companies. Every day his brother would pick him up from school in the bus, perhaps honking out a melody to signal his arrival. They’d take the bus to the car wash and while it sat getting hosed down, Pak Budahar would try his hand at the kalason — what a sound!\nSoon enough, the owner of the bus caught wind of Pak Budahar’s burgeoning talent and convinced him to join his brother as a tukang kalason, a dedicated horn player. By that time, maybe some folks had realized that it was best for the drivers to keep their focus on the road, so some had shifted the keyboard to the center of the dashboard, allowing another employee to sit beside him and provide the tunes. “I didn’t want to work in the fields, I didn’t want to go to school, so off I went!” Pak Budahar described with a wistful smile. Joining his brother on drives across the island, he had all the time in the world to hone his new craft. “As time went by,” he said, “month by month, my fingers got nimbler and I learned more and more songs.”\nThus began a decades-long career as a tukang kalason. The young Budahar was soon poached by bus companies across the region after hearing his talent, and he was making money that other teenagers could only dream of! At the same time, he got to see the world, or Sumatra anyway, driving to far-off ports through the jungly mountains of Riau, North Sumatra, and Bengkulu. Trips that these days take a few hours would back then sometimes take days over pothole-filled roads and dirt tracks that would turn to mud in the rainy season. Sometimes, the bus would get stuck in a rut in the middle of nowhere and everyone would have to hunker down for the night, cooking by the side of the road and sleeping in the bus as the jungle came alive around them.\nThose long drives were like a dream. Harrowing switchbacks like the famous Kelok Sembilan (“Nine Bends”) on the way to Pekanbaru were the perfect place for performance, as the buses would slow to a crawl, allowing the sound of the kalason to better pierce the cabin. Already homesick, passengers would request local folk tunes and modern Minang pop hits, keeping tukang like Pak Budahar on their toes as they filtered those melodies through the developing kalason idiom. At some point, playing kalason became second nature. “Even when dozing off to sleep by the wheel, my fingers would keep on playing!” Pak Budahar told me with a laugh.\nBy the 1970s, passengers began expecting a kalason in any bus they took, even waiting days until they could get a ride on their favorite bus with their tukang of choice. The sounds of kalason whizzed by every village in West Sumatra as the buses made their way through the countryside, becoming a phenomenon that folks would wait on the side of the road just to hear.\nPeople loved the sound so much that some enterprising local record companies started putting out whole albums of kalason music, initially by recording actual bus horns like that of the famous Gumarang Jaya bus, and later with electric organ and synth sounds that imitated the kalason sound and style but with period pop backing tracks. Some musicians like Asben and Melati even became stars associated with the kalason sound despite not being from the bus world at all.\nPak Budahar continued playing and driving into the 1980s, when he finally retired to get married and settle down. The days of kalason were numbered, anyway, as times were changing. Larger, modern diesel buses started being imported from Japan in that decade, and the kalason apparatus didn’t work with these new engines. As the old Chevies were phased out, the kalason and the tukang who played them disappeared along with them. Pak Budahar estimated that the last of the buses with kalason probably drove their final routes in the early 1990s. Then, the music slumbered, living on only in cassette form.\nIn 2012, Pak Budahar was at home with his family in Alahan Panjang, a rural corner of Solok regency, when he heard the familiar musical toot of a horn outside. He went out to find not a bus but a revamped hot rod, a Chevy hardtop that a local car guy named Alfandi had tricked out with a working kalason. Pak Budahar recalled getting in and getting to hear the sound of the kalason come out from under the hood for the first time in decades. “All those years,” he said, “and I’d never forgotten.”\nIt was this new era of kalason revival that got my attention - after reading about the kalason phenomenon on Minangkabau historian Surya Suryadi’s blog, I was amazed to discover a grainy YouTube video of Pak Budahar playing “Sinar Riau” at a car show. Kalason lived! I was able to track down the name of the village and, years later, made it to Alahan Panjang to meet Pak Budahar and hear him play those old kalason hits while sat in Bang Alfandi’s tricked-out hot rod by the shores of Diateh Lake.\nThat was one of the most memorable musical experiences of a lifetime, not only getting to hear Pak Budahar play these old kalason tunes live but also sitting down and listening to his stories of bus life in the ‘60s and ‘70s. He sometimes seemed far away as he recalled those drives: “When I think of that time, I feel like going back.”\nThat era is long past, but I couldn’t help but get caught up in that nostalgic dream. I started scheming up a plan to this music on the road just like back in the day, driving across Sumatra with Pak Budahar as he played the kalason songs of his youth. For years, I held onto these recordings, thinking I’d develop this into something bigger - a documentary? A festival? With Pak Budahar in the front seat.\nOnly recently did I learn that Pak Budahar, already quite sick when I met him, passed away in 2023. One of the last tukang kalason of West Sumatra was now gone. It was Bang Alfandi who told me the news when I reached out to revive my schemes. Up to his last days, he told me, Pak Budahar was still playing the kalason, though his fingers had tensed up in his final years. “Now I still have the kalason,” Bang Alfandi lamented, “but nobody to play it.”\nI can’t help but feel like one of those passengers looking in the rear-view mirror, watching something I love grow farther away, nearly disappearing on the horizon. Is kalason doomed to be an obscure historical footnote? There are still other tukang kalason out there, I’ve since discovered, and at least one other working instrument in Bukittinggi. I’m not sure of the kalason’s future, but for now, let’s take a moment to look longingly out the window as Pak Budahar’s kalason brings solace to our aching hearts.\n+++\nSpecial thank you to Bang Alfandi for graciously supplying the kalason and Pak Budahar’s children, especially Alung, for reaching out and giving their blessings for this post. And again, for the wonderful Pak Budahar - may your kalason sing forever.\nFrom Hafiz Winaldo and Teti Darlenis’ fantastic paper “Fungsi Musik Kalason Oto Sebagai Hiburan Dalam Budaya Transportasi Masyarakat Sumatera Barat.”\nOther great writing on kalason that inspired this post: my friend Luigi Monteanni’s “A Viral Horn for the Global Village,” Bart Barendregt’s “The Sound of ‘Longing for Home,’” Minang historian Surya Suryadi’s incredible blog.", "summary": "(summarizer_error: 401 Client Error: Unauthorized for url: https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions)"}

That’s the case in Java, JavaScript, Python, PHP, Go, etc.\nThere are a few exceptions, though, like Perl, C++, and of course Ruby:\n>> str = String.new\n=> \"\"\n>> str.object_id\n=> 24952\n>> str << \"foo\"\n=> \"foo\"\n>> str\n=> \"foo\"\n>> str.capitalize!\n=> \"Foo\"\n>> str.upcase!\n=> \"FOO\"\n>> str\n=> \"FOO\"\n>> str.object_id\n=> 24952\nImplementation-wise, they’re just an array of bytes, with an associated encoding to know how these bytes should be interpreted:\nclass String\nattr_reader :encoding\ndef initialize\n@bytes = []\n@encoding = Encoding::UTF_8\nend\nend\nThat too is quite unusual.\nString Encoding\nMost languages, especially the ones I listed above, instead have chosen a specific internal encoding, and all strings are encoded that way. For instance, in Java and JavaScript, strings are encoded in UTF-16 because they were created somewhat at the same time as the first Unicode specification, and at that time, many people thought that surely 16 bits should be enough to encode all possible characters, but that later turned out to be wrong. Most other languages, like Python 3, use UTF-8.\nIn these languages, whenever you have to handle text in another encoding, you start by re-encoding it into the internal representation. In Ruby however, strings with different internal encodings can exist in the same program, and Ruby supports over a hundred different encodings:\n>> Encoding.list.size\n=> 103\nWhile I’m not 100% percent certain of why Ruby went that way, I highly suspect it is in big part due to Ruby’s Japanese origin. In the early days of the Unicode specification, there was an attempt at unifying some of the “common” Chinese, Korean, and Japanese characters, as what is now called the Han unification. Because of that character unification attempt, Unicode had lots of problems for Japanese text, hence the Japanese IT industry didn’t adopt Unicode as fast as the Western IT industry did, and for a very long time, Japanese-specific encoding such as Shift JIS remained widespread.\nAs such, being able to work with Japanese text without going through a forced Unicode conversion was an important feature for a large part of Ruby’s core contributors.\nBut let’s go back to mutability.\nPros And Cons\nLike most things in engineering, both immutable and mutable strings have pros and cons, so it’s not like one choice is inherently superior to the other.\nOne of the advantages of immutable strings is that you can more easily share them, for instance:\nsliced_string = very_long_string[1..-1]\nIn the above case, if strings are mutable, you need to copy all but one of the bytes of very_long_string\ninto sliced_string\n, which can be costly.\nBut if strings are immutable, you can instead have sliced_string\ninternally be pointing at the content of very_long_string\nwith just an offset.\nThat is what some languages call String Views, or String slices.\nAnother advantage of immutable strings is that they allow for interning. The idea is simple, if strings can’t be mutated, whenever you have multiple instances of strings with identical content, you can coalesce them into a single instance. This deduplication can be done more or less aggressively, as it’s always a tradeoff in how much CPU time you want to spend searching for duplicates in the hope of saving some memory.\nSome other advantages include not having to worry about mutation in multi-threaded code, as well as dictionary keys. Strings are used a lot as dictionary keys. If you mutate a string, you change its hash code, and that basically breaks hash tables.\nOn the other hand, mutable strings are very handy in some scenarios, like to iteratively build a final string:\nbuffer = \"\"\n10.times do\nbuffer << \"hello\"\nend\nWhereas in a language with immutable strings like Java, concatenating strings in a loop is known as a classic performance gotcha:\nString buffer = \"\";\nfor (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {\nbuffer += \"hello\";\n}\nIn the above example, on every loop, the +=\noperator causes a new string to be allocated, and the content to be copied, which gets exponentially more expensive as the string grows.\nInstead, you are supposed to use a different object as a buffer: StringBuilder\n:\nStringBuilder buffer = new StringBuilder();\nfor (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {\nbuffer.append(\"hello\");\n}\nbuffer.toString();\nThat’s the Java equivalent of appending strings to an array and then calling array.join(\"\")\n.\nIt’s a common enough mistake that at some point the Java compiler gained the ability to detect that pattern and automatically replace it with the equivalent code using StringBuilder\n.\nWhile having to use a different buffer type isn’t the end of the world, I do very much like that it’s not necessary in Ruby.\nBut more generally, the advantage of mutable strings is that for some algorithms, being able to modify the string in place saves a lot of memory allocations and copying.\nRuby Actually Has Both\nEarlier in this post, I said Ruby had mutable strings, but it’s not quite true. Ruby actually has both mutable and immutable strings, because in Ruby, every mutable object can be frozen, hence, Ruby has both mutable and immutable strings, and it takes advantage of this.\nA fun way to poke at Ruby internals is through the ObjectSpace.dump\nmethod.\nrequire \"json\"\nrequire \"objspace\"\ndef dump(obj)\nJSON.pretty_generate(JSON.parse(ObjectSpace.dump(obj)))\nend\nstr = \"Hello World\" * 80\nputs dump(str)\nThe above script will output something like:\n{\n\"address\": \"0x105068e10\",\n\"type\": \"STRING\",\n\"slot_size\": 40,\n\"bytesize\": 880,\n\"memsize\": 921,\n...\n}\nIt tells us the string content is 880B\n(bytesize\n) and that Ruby allocated a 40B\nwide slot (slot_size\n),\nhence the string content is stored in an external buffer for a total of 921B\n(memsize\n).\nNow, look what happens if we slice that string:\nrequire \"json\"\nrequire \"objspace\"\ndef dump(obj)\nJSON.pretty_generate(JSON.parse(ObjectSpace.dump(obj)))\nend\nstr = \"Hello World\" * 80\nputs \"initial str: #{dump(str)}\\n\"\nslice = str[40..-1]\nputs \"str after:\\n#{dump(str)}\\n\"\nputs \"slice:\\n#{dump(slice)}\\n\"\nstr after:\n{\n\"address\": \"0x105178e18\",\n\"type\": \"STRING\",\n\"slot_size\": 40,\n\"shared\": true,\n\"references\": [ \"0x1051786c0\" ],\n\"memsize\": 40,\n...\n}\nslice:\n{\n\"address\": \"0x1051786e8\",\n\"type\": \"STRING\",\n\"slot_size\": 40,\n\"shared\": true,\n\"references\": [ \"0x1051786c0\" ],\n\"memsize\": 40,\n...\n}\nNow, both str\nand slice\nhave the shared: true\nattribute, which indicates that they’re not actually owning their content, they are pointing inside another String object.\nYou can also see that both str\nand slice\nhave a reference to the same object at address: 0x1051786c0\n.\nSo even though it has mutable strings, Ruby is still able to optimize some operations using “string views” like languages with immutable strings.\nHowever, since str\nis mutable, Ruby couldn’t directly create a string view that references str\n, it first had to transfer the buffer ownership to a third String object, and that one is immutable.\nBut if str\nwas frozen, Ruby would have been able to directly create slice\nas a view inside str\n.\nSimilarly, when I was listing some of the pros and cons of mutable strings, I mentioned how mutable strings are a problem when used as hash table keys. Perhaps you’ve never noticed it, but to avoid this problem, Ruby automatically freezes string keys in Hash:\n>> str = \"test\"\n=> \"test\"\n>> str.frozen?\n=> false\n>> hash = { str => 1 }\n=> {\"test\" => 1}\n>> hash.keys.first\n=> \"test\"\n>> hash.keys.first.frozen?\n=> true\n>> [str.object_id, hash.keys.first.object_id]\n=> [16, 24]\nAs you can see, here Ruby couldn’t directly use the str\nstring as a Hash key, it first had to make a frozen copy of it.\nHere, too, if str\nwas frozen, Ruby could have saved the extra work of duplicating this string.\nI believe that illustrates the common tradeoffs at play with mutable strings. On one hand, they can be much more efficient, allowing for in-place modifications, but on the other hand, they impose extra allocations and copying to protect yourself from mutations.\nThe History Of Frozen String Literal\nTo avoid this extra copying overhead, it used to be a fairly common optimization technique to store string literals in constants. For instance, you can see this idiom in a 17 years old patch to rack:\nmodule Rack\nclass MethodOverride\nMETHOD_OVERRIDE_PARAM_KEY = \"_method\".freeze\nHTTP_METHOD_OVERRIDE_HEADER = \"HTTP_X_HTTP_METHOD_OVERRIDE\".freeze\ndef call(env)\n# ...\nmethod = req.POST[METHOD_OVERRIDE_PARAM_KEY] ||\nenv[HTTP_METHOD_OVERRIDE_HEADER]\n# ...\nend\nend\nend\nIt’s this pattern that led Hailey Somerville from GitHub to open a feature request to propose a new syntax for frozen string literals: %f\n.\nreq.POST[%f(_method)] || env[%f(HTTP_X_HTTP_METHOD_OVERRIDE)]\nThis syntax wasn’t accepted, but as a counter proposal, Yusuke Endoh (mame) suggested an “f suffix”:\nreq.POST[\"_method\"f] || env[\"HTTP_X_HTTP_METHOD_OVERRIDE\"f]\nThis one was accepted and implemented in Ruby 2.1.0dev\n.\nHowever, many core developers didn’t like this new syntax, so even after its implementation, multiple counterproposals were made.\nNotably, Akira Tanaka (akr), proposed a file-based directive: # freeze_string: true\n, but it didn’t catch on.\nHowever before the final 2.1.0 release, Charles Nutter opened another feature request,\nand suggested to instead implement a compiler optimization for String#freeze\n, so as to provide the same feature but without introducing a new syntax.\nIf you aren’t familiar with how the Ruby virtual machine works, or virtual machines in general, you may be surprised to hear that Ruby has a compiler, but it absolutely does.\nPrior to Ruby 2.1, the program \"Hello World\".freeze\nwould be compiled by Ruby into a sequence of two instructions:\n>> puts RubyVM::InstructionSequence.compile(%{\"Hello World\".freeze}).disasm\n== disasm: #<ISeq:<compiled>@<compiled>:1 (1,0)-(1,19)>\n0000 putstring \"Hello World\" ( 1)[Li]\n0002 opt_send_without_block <calldata!mid:freeze, argc:0, ARGS_SIMPLE>\n0004 leave\nFirst, a putstring\ninstruction to put \"Hello World\"\non the VM stack, followed by an opt_send_without_block\nto call the #freeze\nmethod on it.\ndef putstring(frozen_string)\n@stack.push(frozen_string.dup)\nend\nWhen invoked, the instruction receives a reference to a frozen String object that has been created by the Ruby compiler.\nBut since the semantics is that the string #freeze\nwill be called on must be mutable, it has to duplicate it, and it’s the mutable copy that is put on the stack.\nIn my opinion, the putstring\ninstruction isn’t correctly named, because its name suggests it just puts the frozen string directly on the stack.\nThis isn’t consistent with other put*\ninstructions like putobject\n, which directly puts an object on the stack without duping it:\ndef putobject(object)\n@stack.push(object)\nend\nBut also inconsistent with some other instructions like duparray\nand duphash\n, which actually behave like putstring\ndoes:\ndef duparray(array)\n@stack.push(array.dup)\nend\nSo it would be much clearer if it had been named dupstring\ninstead of putstring\n.\nBut anyways, Charles’ suggestion was to have the compiler generate a different set of VM instructions when the #freeze\nmethod is called\non a string literal:\n>> puts RubyVM::InstructionSequence.compile(%{\"Hello World\".freeze}).disasm\n== disasm: #<ISeq:<compiled>@<compiled>:1 (1,0)-(1,20)>\n0000 opt_str_freeze \"Hello World\", <calldata!mid:freeze, argc:0, ARGS_SIMPLE>( 1)[Li]\n0003 leave\nAs you can see, on more recent rubies, the putstring\nand opt_send_without_block\ninstructions have been replaced by a single opt_str_freeze\n.\nIts implementation in pseudo-Ruby would be something like:\ndef opt_str_freeze(frozen_string)\nif RubyVM.string_freeze_was_redefined?\n@stack.push(frozen_string.dup.freeze)\nelse\n@stack.push(frozen_string)\nend\nend\nAs you can see, to not break semantics, the instruction has to check that String#freeze\nhasn’t been redefined, but apart from that cheap precondition, the instruction does strictly less work than before.\nThis is the feature Ruby 2.1.0 ultimately shipped with in December 2013.\nFurther Optimizations\nTo further reduce string allocations, in 2014, Aman Karmani (tmm1) and Hailey Somerville (haileys) from GitHub submitted a patch to add two more optimized instructions, opt_aref_with\nand opt_aset_with\n.\nBefore their patch, accessing a hash with a string key would cause a string allocation:\n>> puts RubyVM::InstructionSequence.compile(%{some_hash[\"str\"]}).disasm\n...\n0003 putstring \"str\"\n0005 opt_aref <calldata!mid:[], argc:1, ARGS_SIMPLE>[CcCr]\n0007 leave\nAfter the patch, these two instructions were replaced by a single opt_aref_with\n:\n>> puts RubyVM::InstructionSequence.compile(%{some_hash[\"str\"]}).disasm\n...\n0003 opt_aref_with \"str\", <calldata!mid:[], argc:1, ARGS_SIMPLE>\n0006 leave\nSimilar to opt_str_freeze\n, these instructions would check if the method is being called on a Hash, and if Hash#[]\nhadn’t been redefined.\nWhen both conditions are true, the instruction would be able to look up in the hash without first copying the string.\ndef opt_aref_with(frozen_string)\nif RubyVM.hash_aref_was_redefined? || !@stack.last.is_a?(Hash)\n# fallback\n@stack.push(frozen_string.dup)\nvalue = RubyVM.call_method(:[], 1)\n@stack.push(value)\nelse\n# fast path\nhash = @stack.pop\nvalue = hash[frozen_string]\n@stack.push(value)\nend\nend\nAccording to Aman Karmani, this reduced allocations in GitHub by 3%, which is quite massive for what is a relatively small patch.\nAs a sidenote, this optimized instruction has just been removed by Aaron Paterson on the Ruby trunk, because given most performance-sensitive code already uses the magic comment, this optimization no longer yields much benefit.\nRuby 3.0 And Frozen String Literals\nPerhaps in part because of that new feature, or perhaps because of other reasons. The knowledge of the performance impact of all these useless string duplication in Ruby applications started to spread around 2014, and some community members, notably Richard Scheenman, started to submit pull requests in Rails, rack and a bunch of other gems, with some pretty significant results, such as an 11.9% latency reduction on codetriage.com.\nThese performance gains were generally too good to pass up, but regardless, many people felt that the resulting code was much more ugly. So the question of freezing string by default came back regularly, but was always rejected.\nUntil Akira Matsuda (amatsuda) brought the issue again at the Ruby core developer meeting in August 2015, and there Matz decided that Ruby string literals would be frozen in Ruby 3.0.\nA number of other features to ease the transition were also decided.\nFirst, the # frozen_string_literal: true\nmagic comment was introduced to help gems prepare for Ruby 3.0.\nThen, to ensure that any code that wouldn’t have been made compatible with Ruby 3.0 would remain usable, two Ruby command line options were added: --enable-frozen-string-literal\nand --disable-frozen-string-literal\n.\nThis way, once Ruby 3.0 would be released, if your code or one of your dependencies wasn’t compatible yet, you could just set\nRUBYOPT=\"--disable-frozen-string-literal\"\nand keep going.\nAnd also a --debug-frozen-string-literal\ncommand line option, to help developers.\nAll these new features were released with Ruby 2.3 in December 2015.\nWhat happens when you run Ruby with --enable-frozen-string-literal\nor with the # frozen_string_literal: true\nmagic comment is that the compiler generates a different bytecode:\n>> puts RubyVM::InstructionSequence.compile(%{# frozen_string_literal: true\\n\"Hello World\"}).disasm\n== disasm: #<ISeq:<compiled>@<compiled>:2 (2,0)-(2,13)>\n0000 putobject \"Hello World\" ( 2)[Li]\n0002 leave\nNow, instead of the putstring\ninstruction, the compiler generates a putobject\ninstruction.\nAs I mentioned above, this instruction directly puts the frozen string that was created during compilation on the stack, with no extra duplication.\nSo it’s important to understand that frozen string literals are strictly less work for Ruby than mutable string literals.\nCommunity Usage\nFollowing the release of Ruby 2.3, the Rubocop project added a new cop to enforce the use of the # frozen_string_literal: true\ncomment,\nwith the intent of helping projects be ready for Ruby 3.0 in the future.\nOver the following years, many projects migrated to frozen string literals, including Rails and rake in 2017, Rack in 2018, and of course a long tail of other projects.\nIt’s always hard to say with certainty how much a feature is used, but I think it’s safe to say that, aside from a few projects that deliberately chose not to follow suit, a large majority of the actively developed gems did migrate to frozen string literals. However, many of the more stable and less actively developed gems didn’t.\nThere was no indication of when Ruby 3.0 would be released, and the lack of compatibility with it wasn’t advertised by warnings or any other methods, hence, few people even knew whether any of their dependencies needed to be updated.\nOver time, the magic comment slowly became an incantation most Rubyists follow, in big part because of rubocop, but as far as I know, basically no one was trying to run their application with --enable-frozen-string-literal\n, and few even knew about it.\nAbandoned Plan\nI consider this for years. I REALLY like the idea but I am sure introducing this could cause HUGE compatibility issue, even bigger than Ruby 1.9. So I officially abandon making frozen-string-literals default (for Ruby3).\n– Matz\nI must say this decision did surprise me at the time.\nI definitely understand not wanting to cause a Python 3 sort of moment, but I don’t think frozen string literals would have caused it,\nbecause ultimately you could always have set RUBYOPT=\"--disable-frozen-string-literal\"\nand kept running your applications unchanged if necessary.\nI’m pretty sure if Python 3 had a way of running Python 2 code, the migration would have been much less of a big deal.\nIt was even more surprising to me because Ruby 2.7 also introduced new deprecation warnings in preparation for the keyword argument change in Ruby 3.0, and from my point of view, this breaking change was way bigger than frozen string literals would ever have been.\nIt caused so many deprecations that a Ruby 2.7.2 was later released specifically to turn deprecation warnings off.\nAnd arguably, updating code to support the new keyword argument logic was way more involved than for frozen string literals.\nIf you have a look at the migration guide, it’s fairly long and complex,\nwhereas frozen string literals only need a few strategically placed .dup\nthere and there.\nAs a datapoint, I personally handled the migration of Shopify’s monolith and roughly 700 gem dependencies for both the Ruby 3.0 keyword arguments and for --enable-frozen-string-literal\n.\nFor keyword arguments, I had to send pull requests to almost a hundred gems, as well as change a lot of code in the monolith itself, and some of them were really non-trivial to fix.\nFor frozen string literals, I only had to send pull requests to 12 gems, and it was just a matter of adding a few .dup\ncalls.\nBut anyway, by the time of the Ruby 3.0 release, it had been almost 5 years since the initial plan had been laid out, and most of the performance-sensitive code had migrated to use the magic comment, so this abandonment didn’t spark much discussion, and few people noticed.\nNew Standards\nUntil four years later, in January 2024, I started hearing about standardrb\nand how it doesn’t enforce the presence of the frozen string literal magic comment.\nI also saw a few projects starting to remove them, or new projects deliberately not adding them, because this extra comment at the top is seen as cruft.\nAnd I must say I agree. I hate that comment.\nBack when I started with Ruby, in version 1.8, the default encoding of source files was ASCII, so we frequently had to add a magic comment at the top of the file to tell Ruby they were encoded in UTF-8.\n# encoding: utf-8\nI hated that comment back then, because what I always loved about Ruby is that the source code is almost entirely free of boilerplate. So when Ruby 2.0 made UTF-8 the default encoding, and we could finally get rid of all this cruft, it made me extremely happy.\nI would love to do the same with the frozen string literal comment, but once you are aware of all these useless allocations and copies, it’s really hard to unsee.\nI’m now familiar enough with the VM that when I look at code without the magic comment, I pretty much visualize the implicit dup\ncalls.\nWhen I look at code like this:\nenv[\"HTTPS\"] == \"on\" ? \"https\" : \"http\"\nI can’t help but see this:\nenv[\"HTTPS\".dup] == \"on\".dup ? \"https\".dup : \"http\".dup\nWhich drives me nuts. And yes, these are small strings, and the GC got faster in the last few years, but still, string literals are everywhere, so these allocations add up and cause a death by a thousand cuts.\nSo seeing that the community was slowly unlearning this lesson pained me, and I decided I’d try to revive the initiative.\nChilled String Literals\nIn my opinion, what the initial plan lacked was a proper deprecation path. Many Ruby users had heard the default would change with Ruby 3.0, but Ruby itself never emitted any deprecation to warn users that code would need to be updated, so very little work happened to prepare for it.\nHence, if I wanted to convince Matz to try again, I needed to come up with a way to emit useful deprecation warnings whenever some code would mutate a literal string. That’s where I came up with the concept of chilled strings.\nStarting from Ruby 3.4, when a source file has no frozen_string_literal\ncomment (either true\nor false\n), instead of generating putstring\ninstructions, the compiler now generates putchilledstring\ninstructions:\n>> puts RubyVM::InstructionSequence.compile(%{puts \"Hello World\"}).disasm\n== disasm: #<ISeq:<compiled>@<compiled>:1 (1,0)-(1,18)>\n0000 putself ( 1)[Li]\n0001 putchilledstring \"Hello World\"\n0003 opt_send_without_block <calldata!mid:puts, argc:1, FCALL|ARGS_SIMPLE>\n0005 leave\nThis new instruction is identical to putstring\n, except it additionally marks the newly allocated string with the STR_CHILLED\nflag.\nThen I modified the rb_check_frozen\nfunction, which is responsible for raising FrozenError\nwhen a frozen object is mutated, to also check for that flag.\nWhen a chilled string is mutated, a deprecation warning is emitted, and the flag is removed so that only the very first mutation emits a warning:\n>> Warning[:deprecated] = true\n=> true\n>> \"test\" << \"a\" << \"b\"\n(irb):3: warning: literal string will be frozen in the future (run with --debug-frozen-string-literal for more information)\n=> \"testab\"\nThe migration plan is that in a yet to be defined future version, these deprecation warnings would be visible by default, and then in a further version, frozen string literals would become the default.\nMeasuring The Performance Impact\nJust like in the previous discussions back in 2014, Yusuke Endoh (mame) objected to the change, arguing that the performance benefits of frozen string literals were never properly measured because back in 2014, lots of code wasn’t compatible so it wasn’t possible to measure.\nhow much would the performance degrade if we removed\n# frozen_string_literal: true\nfrom all code used in yjit-bench?\nSo I went ahead and built a modified Ruby interpreter on which the magic comment had no effect, and benchmarked it against mainline Ruby.\nThe results were that frozen string literals make Lobsters, an open source discussion board in Rails, 8-9% faster.\nIt also made railsbench\n, a synthetic Rails application, 4-6% faster, and liquid-render\n11% faster.\nAnd one thing to note is that the benchmarked codebase and its dependencies, like Rack, still contain lots of code that was hand-optimized from the pre-frozen string literal days to avoid allocations. So the difference would be certainly larger if mutable string literals weren’t already worked around.\nSimilarly, back then I was surprised to only see a meager 1-2% gain on the erubi-rails\nbenchmark, given it’s quite string-heavy.\nBut in retrospect, it’s very much expected because one of the biggest performance tricks of erubi is that it works around mutable string literals in its code generation by leveraging opt_str_freeze\ninstructions:\n>> puts Erubi::Engine.new(\"Hello <% name%>!\").src\n_buf = ::String.new; _buf << 'Hello '.freeze; name; _buf << '!'.freeze;\n_buf.to_s\nAll this makes it hard to come up with a clear measure of the performance benefits of freezing string literals. At this point, making them the default is more to allow Rubyists to write nicer and less contrived code, not so much about improving performance.\nAfter some more rounds of discussion, Matz accepted the proposal but without committing to any specific timeline, and I implemented the feature with Étienne Barrié, which shipped with Ruby 3.4.0.\nSo It’s Done?\nSo at this point, it may look like a done deal. The deprecations are in place, it’s just a matter of deciding when to flip the switch.\nBut as we’ve seen in the past, that doesn’t mean much. Matz may still change his mind at any point, and there are still a few Ruby core members actively campaigning against frozen string literals.\nPersonally, I’m quite tired of arguing about it. It might be a personal bias, given the overwhelming majority of the code I interact with has been frozen string literal compatible for a decade, but it seems to me that the Ruby community very largely adopted frozen string literals, so for me it seems obvious to make it the default.\nBut not everyone in Ruby core has the same view of the community. Some members like Mame are very involved in quines and other forms of artistic programming like TRICK, in which mutable string literals are used a lot. So I understand that for him, switching the default means breaking a number of historical programs he cares about.\nUltimately, as always with Ruby’s direction, it will come down to what Matz decides. For now, he has publicly accepted the migration plan, but not yet committed to any timeline, and I’m not sure Matz really has a vision of what the community at large desires on this topic. With Ruby 4.0 being likely released this year, it’s very possible this migration stays in limbo for years and is ultimately abandoned again.\nAlternatives\nAt the end of the day, I don’t care so much about frozen string literals being the default. I just want to be able to stop adding this ugly comment at the top of my files, without losing the performance benefit and without having to explicitly freeze my constants.\nAn alternative to changing the default could be to allow setting compiler options for entire directories.\nThis would allow Rubyists to enable frozen string literals in a single place, typically the gemspec\nor Rails config.\nHowever, this would fragment Ruby more, because it means a given code snippet may or may not work based on where it is located. This was already a concern with the magic comment, it would be an even bigger one with directory-based compiler options. So I’m not sure Matz would be ok with that.\nConclusion\nI can’t predict what the future of string literals in Ruby will be. I do hope they’ll be frozen a few years from now, but I’m not holding my breath.\nIn the meantime I do encourage gem authors to test their gems with --enable-frozen-string-literal\nWhat is certain, however, is that performance-wise, they only have upsides, as they’re strictly less work for the Ruby VM, but your performance-sensitive dependencies likely already use them, or at least work around mutable string literals in the hot paths.\nHence, you are unlikely to notice a big difference if you were to run your application with RUBYOPT=\"--enable-frozen-string-literal\"\n.\nHowever, if you do measure a negative performance impact, there is no doubt you are measuring incorrectly.", "summary": "(summarizer_error: 401 Client Error: Unauthorized for url: https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions)"}

We’re so small in comparison to the Earth that from our point of view, it looks flat.\nThe world is full of such shapes — ones that look flat to an ant living on them, even though they might have a more complicated global structure. Mathematicians call these shapes manifolds. Introduced by Bernhard Riemann in the mid-19th century, manifolds transformed how mathematicians think about space. It was no longer just a physical setting for other mathematical objects, but rather an abstract, well-defined object worth studying in its own right.\nThis new perspective allowed mathematicians to rigorously explore higher-dimensional spaces — leading to the birth of modern topology, a field dedicated to the study of mathematical spaces like manifolds. Manifolds have also come to occupy a central role in fields such as geometry, dynamical systems, data analysis and physics.\nToday, they give mathematicians a common vocabulary for solving all sorts of problems. They’re as fundamental to mathematics as the alphabet is to language. “If I know Cyrillic, do I know Russian?” said Fabrizio Bianchi, a mathematician at the University of Pisa in Italy. “No. But try to learn Russian without learning Cyrillic.”\nSo what are manifolds, and what kind of vocabulary do they provide?\nIdeas Taking Shape\nFor millennia, geometry meant the study of objects in Euclidean space, the flat space we see around us. “Until the 1800s, ‘space’ meant ‘physical space,’” said José Ferreirós, a philosopher of science at the University of Seville in Spain — the analogue of a line in one dimension, or a flat plane in two dimensions.\nIn Euclidean space, things behave as expected: The shortest distance between any two points is a straight line. A triangle’s angles add up to 180 degrees. The tools of calculus are reliable and well defined.\nBut by the early 19th century, some mathematicians had started exploring other kinds of geometric spaces — ones that aren’t flat but rather curved like a sphere or saddle. In these spaces, parallel lines might eventually intersect. A triangle’s angles might add up to more or less than 180 degrees. And doing calculus can become a lot less straightforward.\nThe mathematical community struggled to accept (or even understand) this shift in geometric thinking.\nBut some mathematicians wanted to push these ideas even further. One of them was Bernhard Riemann, a shy young man who had originally planned to study theology — his father was a pastor — before being drawn to mathematics. In 1849, he decided to pursue his doctorate under the tutelage of Carl Friedrich Gauss, who had been studying the intrinsic properties of curves and surfaces, independent of the space surrounding them.\nIn 1854, Riemann was required to deliver a lecture to secure a teaching position at the University of Göttingen. His assigned topic: the foundations of geometry. On June 10, despite a fear of public speaking, he described a new theory in which he generalized Gauss’ ideas about the geometry of surfaces to an arbitrary number of dimensions (and even to infinite dimensions).\nGauss was immediately impressed with the lecture, which involved not just math but also philosophy and physics. But most mathematicians found Riemann’s ideas too vague and abstract to be of much use. “Many scientists and philosophers were saying, ‘This is nonsense,’” Ferreirós said. And so, for decades, the work was largely ignored. Riemann’s lecture didn’t appear in print until 1868, two years after his death.\nBut by the end of the 19th century, mathematical greats like Henri Poincaré had recognized the importance of Riemann’s ideas. And in 1915, Albert Einstein used them in his general theory of relativity, bringing them out of the realm of philosophical abstraction and into the real world. By the middle of the 20th century, they had become a mathematical staple.\nRiemann had introduced a concept that could encompass all possible geometries, in any number of dimensions. A concept that would change how mathematicians view space.\nA manifold.\nCharted Territory\nThe term “manifold” comes from Riemann’s Mannigfaltigkeit, which is German for “variety” or “multiplicity.”\nA manifold is a space that looks Euclidean when you zoom in on any one of its points. For instance, a circle is a one-dimensional manifold. Zoom in anywhere on it, and it will look like a straight line. An ant living on the circle will never know that it’s actually round. But zoom in on a figure eight, right at the point where it crosses itself, and it will never look like a straight line. The ant will realize at that intersection point that it’s not in a Euclidean space. A figure eight is therefore not a manifold.\nSimilarly, in two dimensions, the surface of the Earth is a manifold; zoom in far enough anywhere on it, and it’ll look like a flat 2D plane. But the surface of a double cone — a shape consisting of two cones connected at their tips — is not a manifold.\nManifolds address a problem that mathematicians would otherwise have to deal with: A shape’s properties can change depending on the nature and dimension of the space it lives in (and how it sits in that space). For instance, lay a piece of string on a table, and connect its ends without lifting it. You’ll get a simple loop. Now hold the string in the air and tie its ends together. By considering the string in three dimensions, you can pass it over and under itself before you connect the ends, creating all sorts of knots beyond the simple loop. They all represent the same one-dimensional manifold — the looped string — but they have different properties when considered in two versus three dimensions.\nMathematicians avoid such ambiguities by focusing on the manifold’s intrinsic properties. The defining property of manifolds — that at any point, they look Euclidean — is immensely helpful on that front. Because it’s possible to think about any small patch of the manifold in terms of Euclidean space, mathematicians can use traditional calculus techniques to, say, compute its area or volume, or describe movement on it.\nTo do this, mathematicians divide a given manifold into several overlapping patches and represent each with a “chart” — a set of some number of coordinates (equal to the manifold’s dimension) that tell you where you are on the manifold. Crucially, you also need to write down rules that describe how the coordinates of overlapping charts relate to one another. The collection of all these charts is called an atlas.\nYou can then use this atlas — whose charts translate smaller regions of your potentially complicated manifold into familiar Euclidean space — to measure and explore the manifold one patch at a time. If you want to understand how a function behaves on a manifold, or get a sense of its global structure, you can break the problem up into pieces, solve each piece on a different chart, in Euclidean space, and then stitch together the results from all the charts in the atlas to get the full answer you’re seeking.\nToday, this approach is ubiquitous throughout math and physics.\nManifold Uses\nManifolds are crucial to our understanding of the universe, for one. In his general theory of relativity, Einstein described space-time as a four-dimensional manifold, and gravity as that manifold’s curvature. And the three-dimensional space we see around us is also a manifold — one that, as manifolds do, appears Euclidean to those of us living within it, even though we’re still trying to figure out its global shape.\nEven in cases where manifolds don’t seem to be present, mathematicians and physicists try to rewrite their problems in the language of manifolds to make use of their helpful properties. “So much of physics comes down to understanding geometry,” said Jonathan Sorce, a theoretical physicist at Princeton University. “And often in surprising ways.”\nConsider a double pendulum, which consists of one pendulum hanging from the end of another. Small changes in the double pendulum’s initial conditions lead it to carve out very different trajectories through space, making its behavior hard to predict and understand. But if you represent the configuration of the pendulum with just two angles (one describing the position of each of its arms), then the space of all possible configurations looks like a doughnut, or torus — a manifold. Each point on this torus represents one possible state of the pendulum; paths on the torus represent the trajectories the pendulum might follow through space. This allows researchers to translate their physical questions about the pendulum into geometric ones, making them more intuitive and easier to solve. This is also how they study the movements of fluids, robots, quantum particles and more.\nSimilarly, mathematicians often view the solutions to complicated algebraic equations as a manifold to better understand their properties. And they analyze high-dimensional datasets — such as those recording the activity of thousands of neurons in the brain — by looking at how those data points might sit on a lower-dimensional manifold.\nAsking how scientists use manifolds is akin to asking how they use numbers, Sorce said. “They are at the foundation of everything.”", "summary": "(summarizer_error: 401 Client Error: Unauthorized for url: https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions)"}

A key goal of WebAssembly is performance parity with native code; previous work reports near parity, with many applications compiled to WebAssembly running on average slower than native code. However, this evaluation was limited to a suite of scientific kernels, each consisting of roughly 100 lines of code. Running more substantial applications was not possible because compiling code to WebAssembly is only part of the puzzle: standard Unix APIs are not available in the web browser environment. To address this challenge, we build Browsix-Wasm, a significant extension to Browsix [29] that, for the first time, makes it possible to run unmodified WebAssembly-compiled Unix applications directly inside the browser. We then use Browsix-Wasm to conduct the first large-scale evaluation of the performance of WebAssembly vs. native. Across the SPEC CPU suite of benchmarks, we find a substantial performance gap: applications compiled to WebAssembly run slower by an average of 45% (Firefox) to 55% (Chrome), with peak slowdowns of (Firefox) and (Chrome). We identify the causes of this performance degradation, some of which are due to missing optimizations and code generation issues, while others are inherent to the WebAssembly platform.\n1 Introduction\nWeb browsers have become the most popular platform for running user-facing applications, and until recently, JavaScript was the only programming language supported by all major web browsers. Beyond its many quirks and pitfalls from the perspective of programming language design, JavaScript is also notoriously difficult to compile efficiently [12, 17, 31, 30]. Applications written in or compiled to JavaScript typically run much slower than their native counterparts. To address this situation, a group of browser vendors jointly developed WebAssembly.\nWebAssembly is a low-level, statically typed language that does not require garbage collection, and supports interoperability with JavaScript. The goal of WebAssembly is to serve as a universal compiler target that can run in a browser [16, 15, 18].111The WebAssembly standard is undergoing active development, with ongoing efforts to extend WebAssembly with features ranging from SIMD primitives and threading to tail calls and garbage collection. This paper focuses on the initial and stable version of WebAssembly [18], which is supported by all major browsers. Towards this end, WebAssembly is designed to be fast to compile and run, to be portable across browsers and architectures, and to provide formal guarantees of type and memory safety. Prior attempts at running code at native speed in the browser [13, 14, 4, 38], which we discuss in related work, do not satisfy all of these criteria.\nWebAssembly is now supported by all major browsers [34, 8] and has been swiftly adopted by several programming languages. There are now backends for C, C++, C#, Go, and Rust [39, 24, 2, 1] that target WebAssembly. A curated list currently includes more than a dozen others [10]. Today, code written in these languages can be safely executed in browser sandboxes across any modern device once compiled to WebAssembly.\nA major goal of WebAssembly is to be faster than JavaScript. For example, the paper that introduced WebAssembly [18] showed that when a C program is compiled to WebAssembly instead of JavaScript (asm.js), it runs 34% faster in Google Chrome. That paper also showed that the performance of WebAssembly is competitive with native code: of the 24 benchmarks evaluated, the running time of seven benchmarks using WebAssembly is within 10% of native code, and almost all of them are less than slower than native code. Figure 1 shows that WebAssembly implementations have continuously improved with respect to these benchmarks. In 2017, only seven benchmarks performed within 1.1 of native, but by 2019, this number increased to 13.\nThese results appear promising, but they beg the question: are these 24 benchmarks representative of WebAssembly’s intended use cases?\nThe Challenge of Benchmarking WebAssembly\nThe aforementioned suite of 24 benchmarks is the PolybenchC benchmark suite [5], which is designed to measure the effect of polyhedral loop optimizations in compilers. All the benchmarks in the suite are small scientific computing kernels rather than full applications (e.g., matrix multiplication and LU Decomposition); each is roughly 100 LOC. While WebAssembly is designed to accelerate scientific kernels on the Web, it is also explicitly designed for a much richer set of full applications.\nThe WebAssembly documentation highlights several intended use cases [7], including scientific kernels, image editing, video editing, image recognition, scientific visualization, simulations, programming language interpreters, virtual machines, and POSIX applications. Therefore, WebAssembly’s strong performance on the scientific kernels in PolybenchC do not imply that it will perform well given a different kind of application.\nWe argue that a more comprehensive evaluation of WebAssembly should rely on an established benchmark suite of large programs, such as the SPEC CPU benchmark suites. In fact, the SPEC CPU 2006 and 2017 suite of benchmarks include several applications that fall under the intended use cases of WebAssembly: eight benchmarks are scientific applications (e.g., 433.milc, 444.namd, 447.dealII, 450.soplex, and 470.lbm), two benchmarks involve image and video processing (464.h264ref and 453.povray), and all of the benchmarks are POSIX applications.\nUnfortunately, it is not possible to simply compile a sophisticated native program to WebAssembly. Native programs, including the programs in the SPEC CPU suites, require operating system services, such as a filesystem, synchronous I/O, and processes, which WebAssembly and the browser do not provide. The SPEC benchmarking harness itself requires a file system, a shell, the ability to spawn processes, and other Unix facilities. To overcome these limitations when porting native applications to the web, many programmers painstakingly modify their programs to avoid or mimic missing operating system services. Modifying well-known benchmarks, such as SPEC CPU, would not only be time consuming but would also pose a serious threat to validity.\nThe standard approach to running these applications today is to use Emscripten, a toolchain for compiling C and C++ to WebAssembly [39]. Unfortunately, Emscripten only supports the most trivial system calls and does not scale up to large-scale applications. For example, to enable applications to use synchronous I/O, the default Emscripten MEMFS filesystem loads the entire filesystem image into memory before the program begins executing. For SPEC, these files are too large to fit into memory.\nA promising alternative is to use Browsix, a framework that enables running unmodified, full-featured Unix applications in the browser [28, 29]. Browsix implements a Unix-compatible kernel in JavaScript, with full support for processes, files, pipes, blocking I/O, and other Unix features. Moreover, it includes a C/C++ compiler (based on Emscripten) that allows programs to run in the browser unmodified. The Browsix case studies include complex applications, such as LaTeX, which runs entirely in the browser without any source code modifications.\nUnfortunately, Browsix is a JavaScript-only solution, since it was built before the release of WebAssembly. Moreover, Browsix suffers from high performance overhead, which would be a significant confounder while benchmarking. Using Browsix, it would be difficult to tease apart the poorly performing benchmarks from performance degradation introduced by Browsix.\nContributions\n-\n•\nBrowsix-Wasm: We develop Browsix-Wasm, a significant extension to and enhancement of Browsix that allows us to compile Unix programs to WebAssembly and run them in the browser with no modifications. In addition to integrating functional extensions, Browsix-Wasm incorporates performance optimizations that drastically improve its performance, ensuring that CPU-intensive applications operate with virtually no overhead imposed by Browsix-Wasm ().\n-\n•\nBrowsix-SPEC: We develop Browsix-SPEC, a harness that extends Browsix-Wasm to allow automated collection of detailed timing and hardware on-chip performance counter information in order to perform detailed measurements of application performance ().\n-\n•\nPerformance Analysis of WebAssembly: Using Browsix-Wasm and Browsix-SPEC, we conduct the first comprehensive performance analysis of WebAssembly using the SPEC CPU benchmark suite (both 2006 and 2017). This evaluation confirms that WebAssembly does run faster than JavaScript (on average 1.3 faster across SPEC CPU). However, contrary to prior work, we find a substantial gap between WebAssembly and native performance: code compiled to WebAssembly runs on average 1.55 slower in Chrome and 1.45 slower in Firefox than native code ().\n-\n•\nRoot Cause Analysis and Advice for Implementers: We conduct a forensic analysis with the aid of performance counter results to identify the root causes of this performance gap. We find the following results:\n-\n1.\nThe instructions produced by WebAssembly have more loads and stores than native code (2.02 more loads and 2.30 more stores in Chrome; 1.92 more loads and 2.16 more stores in Firefox). We attribute this to reduced availability of registers, a sub-optimal register allocator, and a failure to effectively exploit a wider range of x86 addressing modes.\n-\n2.\nThe instructions produced by WebAssembly have more branches, because WebAssembly requires several dynamic safety checks.\n-\n3.\nSince WebAssembly generates more instructions, it leads to more L1 instruction cache misses.\nWe provide guidance to help WebAssembly implementers focus their optimization efforts in order to close the performance gap between WebAssembly and native code ().\n-\n1.\nBrowsix-Wasm and Browsix-SPEC are available at https://browsix.org.\n2 From Browsix to Browsix-Wasm\nBrowsix [29] mimics a Unix kernel within the browser and includes a compiler (based on Emscripten [39, 33]) that compiles native programs to JavaScript. Together, they allow native programs (in C, C++, and Go) to run in the browser and freely use operating system services, such as pipes, processes, and a filesystem. However, Browsix has two major limitations that we must overcome. First, Browsix compiles native code to JavaScript and not WebAssembly. Second, the Browsix kernel has significant performance issues. In particular, several common system calls have very high overhead in Browsix, which makes it hard to compare the performance of a program running in Browsix to that of a program running natively. We address these limitations by building a new in-browser kernel called Browsix-Wasm, which supports WebAssembly programs and eliminates the performance bottlenecks of Browsix.\nEmscripten Runtime Modifications\nBrowsix modifies the Emscripten compiler to allow processes (which run in WebWorkers) to communicate with the Browsix kernel (which runs on the main thread of a page). Since Browsix compiles native programs to JavaScript, this is relatively straightforward: each process’ memory is a buffer that is shared with the kernel (a SharedArrayBuffer), thus system calls can directly read and write process memory. However, this approach has two significant drawbacks. First, it precludes growing the heap on-demand; the shared memory must be sized large enough to meet the high-water-mark heap size of the application for the entire life of the process. Second, JavaScript contexts (like the main context and each web worker context) have a fixed limit on their heap sizes, which is currently approximately 2.2 GB in Google Chrome [6]. This cap imposes a serious limitation on running multiple processes: if each process reserves a 500 MB heap, Browsix would only be able to run at most four concurrent processes. A deeper problem is that WebAssembly memory cannot be shared across WebWorkers and does not support the Atomic API, which Browsix processes use to wait for system calls.\nBrowsix-Wasm uses a different approach to process-kernel communication that is also faster than the Browsix approach. Browsix-Wasm modifies the Emscripten runtime system to create an auxiliary buffer (of 64MB) for each process that is shared with the kernel, but is distinct from process memory. Since this auxiliary buffer is a SharedArrayBuffer the Browsix-Wasm process and kernel can use Atomic API for communication. When a system call references strings or buffers in the process’s heap (e.g., writev or stat), its runtime system copies data from the process memory to the shared buffer and sends a message to the kernel with locations of the copied data in auxiliary memory. Similarly, when a system call writes data to the auxiliary buffer (e.g., read), its runtime system copies the data from the shared buffer to the process memory at the memory specified. Moreover, if a system call specifies a buffer in process memory for the kernel to write to (e.g., read), the runtime allocates a corresponding buffer in auxiliary memory and passes it to the kernel. In case the system call is either reading or writing data of size more than 64MB, Browsix-Wasm divides this call into several calls such that each call only reads or writes at maximum 64MB of data. The cost of these memory copy operations is dwarfed by the overall cost of the system call invocation, which involves sending a message between process and kernel JavaScript contexts. We show in §4.2.1 that Browsix-Wasm has negligible overhead.\nPerformance Optimization\nWhile building Browsix-Wasm and doing our preliminary performance evaluation, we discovered several performance issues in parts of the Browsix kernel. Left unresolved, these performance issues would be a threat to the validity of a performance comparison between WebAssembly and native code. The most serious case was in the shared filesystem component included with Browsix/Browsix-Wasm, BrowserFS. Originally, on each append operation on a file, BrowserFS would allocate a new, larger buffer, copying the previous and new contents into the new buffer. Small appends could impose substantial performance degradation. Now, whenever a buffer backing a file requires additional space, BrowserFS grows the buffer by at least 4 KB. This change alone decreased the time the 464.h264ref benchmark spent in Browsix from 25 seconds to under 1.5 seconds. We made a series of improvements that reduce overhead throughout Browsix-Wasm. Similar, if less dramatic, improvements were made to reduce the number of allocations and the amount of copying in the kernel implementation of pipes.\n3 Browsix-SPEC\nTo reliably execute WebAssembly benchmarks while capturing performance counter data, we developed Browsix-SPEC. Browsix-SPEC works with Browsix-Wasm to manage spawning browser instances, serving benchmark assets (e.g., the compiled WebAssembly programs and test inputs), spawning perf processes to record performance counter data, and validating benchmark outputs.\nWe use Browsix-SPEC to run three benchmark suites to evaluate WebAssembly’s performance: SPEC CPU2006, SPEC CPU2017, and PolyBenchC. These benchmarks are compiled to native code using Clang 4.0, and WebAssembly using Browsix-Wasm. We made no modifications to Chrome or Firefox, and the browsers are run with their standard sandboxing and isolation features enabled. Browsix-Wasm is built on top of standard web platform features and requires no direct access to host resources – instead, benchmarks make standard HTTP requests to Browsix-SPEC.\n3.1 Browsix-SPEC Benchmark Execution\nFigure 2 illustrates the key pieces of Browsix-SPEC in play when running a benchmark, such as 401.bzip2 in Chrome. First (1), the Browsix-SPEC benchmark harness launches a new browser instance using a WebBrowser automation tool, Selenium.222https://www.seleniumhq.org/ (2) The browser loads the page’s HTML, harness JS, and Browsix-Wasm kernel JS over HTTP from the benchmark harness. (3) The harness JS initializes the Browsix-Wasm kernel and starts a new Browsix-Wasm process executing the runspec shell script (not shown in Figure 2). runspec in turn spawns the standard specinvoke (not shown), compiled from the C sources provided in SPEC 2006. specinvoke reads the speccmds.cmd file from the Browsix-Wasm filesystem and starts 401.bzip2 with the appropriate arguments. (4) After the WebAssembly module has been instantiated but before the benchmark’s main function is invoked, the Browsix-Wasm userspace runtime does an XHR request to Browsix-SPEC to begin recording performance counter stats. (5) The benchmark harness finds the Chrome thread corresponding to the Web Worker 401.bzip2 process and attaches perf to the process. (6) At the end of the benchmark, the Browsix-Wasm userspace runtime does a final XHR to the benchmark harness to end the perf record process. When the runspec program exits (after potentially invoking the test binary several times), the harness JS POSTs (7) a tar archive of the SPEC results directory to Browsix-SPEC. After Browsix-SPEC receives the full results archive, it unpacks the results to a temporary directory and validates the output using the cmp tool provided with SPEC 2006. Finally, Browsix-SPEC kills the browser process and records the benchmark results.\n4 Evaluation\nWe use Browsix-Wasm and Browsix-SPEC to evaluate the performance of WebAssembly using three benchmark suites: SPEC CPU2006, SPEC CPU2017, and PolyBenchC. We include PolybenchC benchmarks for comparison with the original WebAssembly paper [18], but argue that these benchmarks do not represent typical workloads. The SPEC benchmarks are representative and require Browsix-Wasm to run successfully. We run all benchmarks on a 6-Core Intel Xeon E5-1650 v3 CPU with hyperthreading and 64 GB of RAM running Ubuntu 16.04 with Linux kernel v4.4.0. We run all benchmarks using two state-of-the-art browsers: Google Chrome 74.0 and Mozilla Firefox 66.0. We compile benchmarks to native code using Clang 4.0333The flags to Clang are -O2 -fno-strict-aliasing. and to WebAssembly using Browsix-Wasm (which is based on Emscripten with Clang 4.0).444Browsix-Wasm runs Emscripten with the flags -O2 -s TOTAL_MEMORY=1073741824 -s ALLOW_MEMORY_GROWTH=1 -fno-strict-aliasing. Each benchmark was executed five times. We report the average of all running times and the standard error. The execution time measured is the difference between wall clock time when the program starts, i.e. after WebAssembly JIT compilation concludes, and when the program ends.\n4.1 PolyBenchC Benchmarks\nHaas et al. [18] used PolybenchC to benchmark WebAssembly implementations because the PolybenchC benchmarks do not make system calls. As we have already argued, the PolybenchC benchmarks are small scientific kernels that are typically used to benchmark polyhedral optimization techniques, and do not represent larger applications. Nevertheless, it is still valuable for us to run PolybenchC with Browsix-Wasm, because it demonstrates that our infrastructure for system calls does not have any overhead. Figure 3(a) shows the execution time of the PolyBenchC benchmarks in Browsix-Wasm and when run natively. We are able to reproduce the majority of the results from the original WebAssembly paper [18]. We find that Browsix-Wasm imposes a very low overhead: an average of 0.2% and a maximum of 1.2%.\n4.2 SPEC Benchmarks\nWe now evaluate Browsix-Wasm using the C/C++ benchmarks from SPEC CPU2006 and SPEC CPU2017 (the new C/C++ benchmarks and the speed benchmarks), which use system calls extensively. We exclude four data points that either do not compile to WebAssembly555400.perlbench, 403.gcc, 471.omnetpp, and 456.hmmer from SPEC CPU2006 do not compile with Emscripten. or allocate more memory than WebAssembly allows.666From SPEC CPU2017, the ref dataset of 638.imagick_s and 657.xz_s require more than 4 GB RAM. However, these benchmarks do work with their test dataset. Table 1 shows the absolute execution times of the SPEC benchmarks when running with Browsix-Wasm in both Chrome and Firefox, and when running natively.\nWebAssembly performs worse than native for all benchmarks except for 429.mcf and 433.milc. In Chrome, WebAssembly’s maximum overhead is 2.5 over native and 7 out of 15 benchmarks have a running time within 1.5 of native. In Firefox, WebAssembly is within 2.08 of native and performs within 1.5 of native for 7 out of 15 benchmarks. On average, WebAssembly is 1.55 slower than native in Chrome, and 1.45 slower than native in Firefox. Table 2 shows the time required to compile the SPEC benchmarks using Clang and Chrome. (To the best of our knowledge, Firefox cannot report WebAssembly compile times.) In all cases, the compilation time is negligible compared to the execution time. However, the Clang compiler is orders of magnitude slower than the WebAssembly compiler. Finally, note that Clang compiles benchmarks from C++ source code, whereas Chrome compiles WebAssembly, which is a simpler format than C++.\n| Benchmark | Native | Google Chrome | Mozilla Firefox |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| 401.bzip2 | 370 0.6 | 864 6.4 | 730 1.3 |\n| 429.mcf | 221 0.1 | 180 0.9 | 184 0.6 |\n| 433.milc | 375 2.6 | 369 0.5 | 378 0.6 |\n| 444.namd | 271 0.8 | 369 9.1 | 373 1.8 |\n| 445.gobmk | 352 2.1 | 537 0.8 | 549 3.3 |\n| 450.soplex | 179 3.7 | 265 1.2 | 238 0.5 |\n| 453.povray | 110 1.9 | 275 1.3 | 229 1.5 |\n| 458.sjeng | 358 1.4 | 602 2.5 | 580 2.0 |\n| 462.libquantum | 330 0.8 | 444 0.2 | 385 0.8 |\n| 464.h264ref | 389 0.7 | 807 11.0 | 733 2.4 |\n| 470.lbm | 209 1.1 | 248 0.3 | 249 0.5 |\n| 473.astar | 299 0.5 | 474 3.5 | 408 1.0 |\n| 482.sphinx3 | 381 7.1 | 834 1.8 | 713 3.6 |\n| 641.leela_s | 466 2.7 | 825 4.6 | 717 1.2 |\n| 644.nab_s | 2476 11 | 3639 5.6 | 3829 6.7 |\n| Slowdown: geomean | – | 1.55 | 1.45 |\n| Slowdown: median | – | 1.53 | 1.54 |\n| Benchmark | Clang 4.0 | Google Chrome |\n|---|---|---|\n| 401.bzip2 | 1.9 0.018 | 0.53 0.005 |\n| 429.mcf | 0.3 0.003 | 0.15 0.005 |\n| 433.milc | 2.2 0.02 | 0.3 0.003 |\n| 444.namd | 4.6 0.02 | 0.78 0.004 |\n| 445.gobmk | 12.1 0.2 | 1.4 0.014 |\n| 450.soplex | 6.9 0.01 | 1.2 0.009 |\n| 453.povray | 15.3 0.03 | 1.2 0.012 |\n| 458.sjeng | 1.9 0.01 | 0.35 0.001 |\n| 462.libquantum | 6.9 0.03 | 0.15 0.002 |\n| 464.h264ref | 10.3 0.06 | 1.0 0.03 |\n| 470.lbm | 0.3 0.001 | 0.14 0.004 |\n| 473.astar | 0.73 0.005 | 0.24 0.004 |\n| 482.sphinx3 | 3.0 0.04 | 0.48 0.007 |\n| 641.leela_s | 4.3 0.05 | 0.74 0.003 |\n| 644.nab_s | 4.1 0.03 | 0.41 0.001 |\n4.2.1 Browsix-Wasm Overhead\nIt is important to rule out the possibility that the slowdown that we report is due to poor performance in our implementation of Browsix-Wasm. In particular, Browsix-Wasm implements system calls without modifying the browser, and system calls involve copying data (§2), which may be costly. To quantify the overhead of Browsix-Wasm, we instrumented its system calls to measure all time spent in Browsix-Wasm. Figure 4 shows the percentage of time spent in Browsix-Wasm in Firefox using the SPEC benchmarks. For 14 of the 15 benchmarks, the overhead is less than 0.5%. The maximum overhead is 1.2%. On average, the overhead of Browsix-Wasm is only 0.2%. Therefore, we conclude that Browsix-Wasm has negligible overhead and does not substantially affect the performance counter results of programs executed in WebAssembly.\n4.2.2 Comparison of WebAssembly and asm.js\nA key claim in the original work on WebAssembly was that it is significantly faster than asm.js. We now test that claim using the SPEC benchmarks. For this comparison, we modified Browsix-Wasm to also support processes compiled to asm.js. The alternative would have been to benchmark the asm.js processes using the original Browsix. However, as we discussed earlier, Browsix has performance problems that would have been a threat to the validity of our results. Figure 5 shows the speedup of the SPEC benchmarks using WebAssembly, relative to their running time using asm.js using both Chrome and Firefox. WebAssembly outperforms asm.js in both browsers: the mean speedup is 1.54 in Chrome and 1.39 in Firefox.\nSince the performance difference between Chrome and Firefox is substantial, in Figure 6 we show the speedup of each benchmark by selecting the best-performing browser for WebAssembly and the best-performing browser of asm.js (i.e., they may be different browsers). These results show that WebAssembly consistently performs better than asm.js, with a mean speedup of 1.3. Haas et al. [18] also found that WebAssembly gives a mean speedup of 1.3 over asm.js using PolyBenchC.\n5 Case Study: Matrix Multiplication\nIn this section, we illustrate the performance differences between WebAssembly and native code using a C function that performs matrix multiplication, as shown in Figure 7(a). Three matrices are provided as arguments to the function, and the results of A () and B () are stored in C (), where are constants defined in the program.\nIn WebAssembly, this function is – slower than native in both Chrome and Firefox with a variety of matrix sizes (Figure 8). We compiled the function with -O2 and disabled automatic vectorization, since WebAssembly does not support vectorized instructions.\nFigure 7(b) shows native code generated for the matmul function by clang-4.0. Arguments are passed to the function in the rdi, rsi, and rdx registers, as specified in the System V AMD64 ABI calling convention [9]. Lines 7(b) - 7(b) are the body of the first loop with iterator i stored in r8d. Lines 7(b) - 7(b) contain the body of the second loop with iterator k stored in r9d. Lines 7(b) - 7(b) comprise the body of the third loop with iterator j stored in rcx. Clang is able to eliminate a cmp instruction in the inner loop by initializing rcx with , incrementing rcx on each iteration at line 7(b), and using jne to test the zero flag of the status register, which is set to 1 when rcx becomes 0.\nFigure 7(c) shows x86-64 code JITed by Chrome for the WebAssembly compiled version of matmul. This code has been modified slightly – nops in the generated code have been removed for presentation. Function arguments are passed in the rax, rcx, and rdx registers, following Chrome’s calling convention. At lines 1– 3, the contents of registers rax, rdx, and rcx are stored on the stack, due to registers spills at lines 7 - 9. Lines 7–45 are the body of the first loop with iterator i stored in edi. Lines 18–42 contain the body of second loop with iterator k stored in r11. Lines 27–39 are the body of the third loop with iterator j stored in eax. To avoid memory loads due to register spilling at lines 7– 9 in the first iteration of the first loop, an extra jump is generated at line 5. Similarly, extra jumps are generated for the second and third loops at line 16 and line 25 respectively.\n5.1 Differences\nThe native code JITed by Chrome has more instructions, suffers from increased register pressure, and has extra branches compared to Clang-generated native code.\n5.1.1 Increased Code Size\nThe number of instructions in the code generated by Chrome (Figure 7(c)) is 53, including nops, while clang generated code (Figure 7(b)) consists of only 28 instructions. The poor instruction selection algorithm of Chrome is one of the reasons for increased code size.\nAdditionally, Chrome does not take advantage of all available memory addressing modes for x86 instructions. In Figure 7(b) Clang uses the add instruction at line 7(b) with register addressing mode, loading from and writing to a memory address in the same operation. Chrome on the other hand loads the address in ecx, adds the operand to ecx, finally storing ecx at the address, requiring 3 instructions rather than one on lines 3537.\n5.1.2 Increased Register Pressure\nCode generated by Clang in Figure 7(b) does not generate any spills and uses only 10 registers. On the other hand, the code generated by Chrome (Figure 7(c)) uses 13 general purpose registers – all available registers (r13 and r10 are reserved by V8). As described in Section 5.1.1, eschewing the use of the register addressing mode of the add instruction requires the use of a temporary register. All of this register inefficiency compounds, introducing three register spills to the stack at lines 1–3. Values stored on the stack are loaded again into registers at lines 7–9 and line 18.\n5.1.3 Extra Branches\nClang (Figure 7(b)) generates code with a single branch per loop by inverting the loop counter (line 7(b)). In contrast, Chrome (Figure 7(c)) generates more straightforward code, which requires a conditional jump at the start of the loop. In addition, Chrome generates extra jumps to avoid memory loads due to register spills in the first iteration of a loop. For example, the jump at line 5 avoids the spills at lines 7– 9.\n6 Performance Analysis\n| perf Event | Wasm Summary |\n| all-loads-retired (r81d0) (Figure 9(a)) | Increased register |\n| all-stores-retired (r82d0) (Figure 9(b)) | pressure |\n| branches-retired (r00c4) (Figure 9(c)) | More branch |\n| conditional-branches (r01c4) (Figure 9(d)) | statements |\n| instructions-retired (r1c0) (Figure 9(e)) | Increased code size |\n| cpu-cycles (Figure 9(f)) | |\n| L1-icache-load-misses (Figure 10) |\nWe use Browsix-SPEC to record measurements from all supported performance counters on our system for the SPEC CPU benchmarks compiled to WebAssembly and executed in Chrome and Firefox, and the SPEC CPU benchmarks compiled to native code (Section 3).\nTable 3 lists the performance counters we use here, along with a summary of the impact of Browsix-Wasm performance on these counters compared to native. We use these results to explain the performance overhead of WebAssembly over native code. Our analysis shows that the inefficiences described in Section 5 are pervasive and translate to reduced performance across the SPEC CPU benchmark suite.\n6.1 Increased Register Pressure\nThis section focuses on two performance counters that show the effect of increased register pressure. Figure 9(a) presents the number of load instructions retired by WebAssembly-compiled SPEC benchmarks in Chrome and Firefox, relative to the number of load instructions retired in native code. Similarly, Figure 9(b) shows the number of store instructions retired. Note that a “retired” instruction is an instruction which leaves the instruction pipeline and its results are correct and visible in the architectural state (that is, not speculative).\nCode generated by Chrome has 2.02 more load instructions retired and 2.30 more store instructions retired than native code. Code generated by Firefox has 1.92 more load instructions retired and 2.16 more store instructions retired than native code. These results show that the WebAssembly-compiled SPEC CPU benchmarks suffer from increased register pressure and thus increased memory references. Below, we outline the reasons for this increased register pressure.\n6.1.1 Reserved Registers\nIn Chrome, matmul generates three register spills but does not use two x86-64 registers: r13 and r10 (Figure 7(c), lines 7– 9). This occurs because Chrome reserves these two registers.777https://github.com/v8/v8/blob/7.4.1/src/x64/register-x64.h For the JavaScript garbage collector, Chrome reserves r13 to point to an array of GC roots at all times. In addition, Chrome uses r10 and xmm13 as dedicated scratch registers. Similarly, Firefox reserves r15 as a pointer to the start of the heap, and r11 and xmm15 are JavaScript scratch registers.888https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/tip/js/src/jit/x64/Assembler-x64.h None of these registers are available to WebAssembly code.\n6.1.2 Poor Register Allocation\nBeyond a reduced set of registers available to allocate, both Chrome and Firefox do a poor job of allocating the registers they have. For example, the code generated by Chrome for matmul uses 12 registers while the native code generated by Clang only uses 10 registers (Section 5.1.2). This increased register usage—in both Firefox and Chrome—is because of their use of fast but not particularly effective register allocators. Chrome and Firefox both use a linear scan register allocator [36], while Clang uses a greedy graph-coloring register allocator [3], which consistently generates better code.\n6.1.3 x86 Addressing Modes\nThe x86-64 instruction set offers several addressing modes for each operand, including a register mode, where the instruction reads data from register or writes data to a register, and memory address modes like register indirect or direct offset addressing, where the operand resides in a memory address and the instruction can read from or write to that address. A code generator could avoid unnecessary register pressure by using the latter modes. However, Chrome does not take advantage of these modes. For example, the code generated by Chrome for matmul does not use the register indirect addressing mode for the add instruction (Section 5.1.2), creating unnecessary register pressure.\n6.2 Extra Branch Instructions\nThis section focuses on two performance counters that measure the number of branch instructions executed. Figure 9(c) shows the number of branch instructions retired by WebAssembly, relative to the number of branch instructions retired in native code. Similarly, Figure 9(d) shows the number of conditional branch instructions retired. In Chrome, there are and more unconditional and conditional branch instructions retired respectively, whereas in Firefox, there are and more retired. These results show that all the SPEC CPU benchmarks incur extra branches, and we explain why below.\n6.2.1 Extra Jump Statements for Loops\nAs with matmul (Section 5.1.3), Chrome generates unnecessary jump statements for loops, leading to significantly more branch instructions than Firefox.\n6.2.2 Stack Overflow Checks Per Function Call\nA WebAssembly program tracks the current stack size with a global variable that it increases on every function call. The programmer can define the maximum stack size for the program. To ensure that a program does not overflow the stack, both Chrome and Firefox add stack checks at the start of each function to detect if the current stack size is less than the maximum stack size. These checks includes extra comparison and conditional jump instructions, which must be executed on every function call.\n6.2.3 Function Table Indexing Checks\nWebAssembly dynamically checks all indirect calls to ensure that the target is a valid function and that the function’s type at runtime is the same as the type specified at the call site. In a WebAssembly module, the function table stores the list of functions and their types, and the code generated by WebAssembly uses the function table to implement these checks. These checks are required when calling function pointers and virtual functions in C/C++. The checks lead to extra comparison and conditional jump instructions, which are executed before every indirect function call.\n6.3 Increased Code Size\nThe code generated by Chrome and Firefox is considerably larger than the code generated by Clang. We use three performance counters to measure this effect. (i) Figure 9(e) shows the number of instructions retired by benchmarks compiled to WebAssembly and executed in Chrome and Firefox relative to the number of instructions retired in native code. Similarly, Figure 9(f) shows the relative number of CPU cycles spent by benchmarks compiled to WebAssembly, and Figure 10 shows the relative number of L1 instruction cache load misses.\nFigure 9(e) shows that Chrome executes an average of 1.80 more instructions than native code and Firefox executes an average of 1.75 more instructions than native code. Due to poor instruction selection, a poor register allocator generating more register spills (Section 6.1), and extra branch statements (Section 6.2), the size of generated code for WebAssembly is greater than native code, leading to more instructions being executed. This increase in the number of instructions executed leads to increased L1 instruction cache misses in Figure 10. On average, Chrome suffers 2.83 more I-cache misses than native code, and Firefox suffers from 2.04 more L1 instruction cache misses than native code. More cache misses means that more CPU cycles are spent waiting for the instruction to be fetched.\nWe note one anomaly: although 429.mcf has 1.6 more instructions retired in Chrome than native code and 1.5 more instructions retired in Firefox than native code, it runs faster than native code. Figure 3(b) shows that its slowdown relative to native is 0.81 in Chrome and 0.83 in Firefox. The reason for this anomaly is attributable directly to its lower number of L1 instruction cache misses. 429.mcf contains a main loop and most of the instructions in the loop fit in the L1 instruction cache. Similarly, 433.milc performance is better due to fewer L1 instruction cache misses. In 450.soplex there are 4.6 more L1 instruction cache misses in Chrome and Firefox than native because of several virtual functions being executed, leading to more indirect function calls.\n| Performance Counter | Chrome | Firefox |\n| all-loads-retired | 2.02 | 1.92 |\n| all-stores-retired | 2.30 | 2.16 |\n| branch-instructions-retired | 1.75 | 1.65 |\n| conditional-branches | 1.65 | 1.62 |\n| instructions-retired | 1.80 | 1.75 |\n| cpu-cycles | 1.54 | 1.38 |\n| L1-icache-load-misses | 2.83 | 2.04 |\n6.4 Discussion\nIt is worth asking if the performance issues identified here are fundamental. We believe that two of the identified issues are not: that is, they could be ameliorated by improved implementations. WebAssembly implementations today use register allocators (§6.1.2) and code generators (§6.2.1) that perform worse than Clang’s counterparts. However, an offline compiler like Clang can spend considerably more time to generate better code, whereas WebAssembly compilers must be fast enough to run online. Therefore, solutions adopted by other JITs, such as further optimizing hot code, are likely applicable here [19, 32].\nThe four other issues that we have identified appear to arise from the design constraints of WebAssembly: the stack overflow checks (§6.2.2), indirect call checks (§6.2.3), and reserved registers (§6.1.1) have a runtime cost and lead to increased code size (§6.3). Unfortunately, these checks are necessary for WebAssembly’s safety guarantees. A redesigned WebAssembly, with richer types for memory and function pointers [23], might be able to perform some of these checks at compile time, but that could complicate the implementation of compilers that produce WebAssembly. Finally, a WebAssembly implementation in a browser must interoperate with a high-performance JavaScript implementation, which may impose its own constraints. For example, current JavaScript implementations reserve a few registers for their own use, which increases register pressure on WebAssembly.\n7 Related Work\nPrecursors to WebAssembly\nThere have been several attempts to execute native code in browsers, but none of them met all the design criteria of WebAssembly.\nActiveX [13] allows web pages to embed signed x86 libraries, however these binaries have unrestricted access to the Windows API. In contrast, WebAssembly modules are sandboxed. ActiveX is now a deprecated technology.\nNative Client [37, 11] (NaCl) adds a module to a web application that contains platform specific machine code. NaCl introduced sandboxing techniques to execute platform specific machine code at near native speed. Since NaCl relies on static validation of machine code, it requires code generators to follow certain patterns, hence, supporting only a subset of the x86, ARM, and MIPS instructions sets in the browser. To address the inherent portability issue of NaCl, Portable NaCl (PNaCl) [14] uses LLVM Bitcode as a binary format. However, PNaCl does not provide significant improvement in compactness over NaCl and still exposes compiler and/or platform-specific details such as the call stack layout. Both have been deprecated in favor of WebAssembly.\nasm.js is a subset of JavaScript designed to be compiled efficiently to native code. asm.js uses type coercions to avoid the dynamic type system of JavaScript. Since asm.js is a subset of JavaScript, adding all native features to asm.js such as 64-bit integers will first require extending JavaScript. Compared to asm.js, WebAssembly provides several improvements: (i) WebAssembly binaries are compact due to its lightweight representation compared to JavaScript source, (ii) WebAssembly is more straightforward to validate, (iii) WebAssembly provides formal guarantees of type safety and isolation, and (iv) WebAssembly has been shown to provide better performance than asm.js.\nWebAssembly is a stack machine, which is similar to the Java Virtual Machine [21] and the Common Language Runtime [25]. However, WebAssembly is very different from these platforms. For example WebAssembly does not support objects and does not support unstructured control flow.\nThe WebAssembly specification defines its operational semantics and type system. This proof was mechanized using the Isabelle theorem prover, and that mechanization effort found and addressed a number of issues in the specification [35]. RockSalt [22] is a similar verification effort for NaCl. It implements the NaCl verification toolchain in Coq, along with a proof of correctness with respect to a model of the subset of x86 instructions that NaCl supports.\nAnalysis of SPEC Benchmarks using performance counters\nSeveral papers use performance counters to analyze the SPEC benchmarks. Panda et al. [26] analyze the SPEC CPU2017 benchmarks, applying statistical techniques to identify similarities among benchmarks. Phansalkar et al. perform a similar study on SPEC CPU2006 [27]. Limaye and Adegija identify workload differences between SPEC CPU2006 and SPEC CPU2017 [20].\n8 Conclusions\nThis paper performs the first comprehensive performance analysis of WebAssembly. We develop Browsix-Wasm, a significant extension of Browsix, and Browsix-SPEC, a harness that enables detailed performance analysis, to let us run the SPEC CPU2006 and CPU2017 benchmarks as WebAssembly in Chrome and Firefox. We find that the mean slowdown of WebAssembly vs. native across SPEC benchmarks is 1.55 for Chrome and 1.45 for Firefox, with peak slowdowns of 2.5 in Chrome and 2.08 in Firefox. We identify the causes of these performance gaps, providing actionable guidance for future optimization efforts.\nAcknowledgements\nWe thank the reviewers and our shepherd, Eric Eide, for their constructive feedback.

The site has been blocked in various countries, was sued in the U.S. after it scraped WorldCat, and actively provides assistance to AI researchers who want to use its library for model training.\nDespite legal pressure, Annas-archive.org and the related .li and .se domains remain operational. This is a thorn in the side of publishers who are actively trying to take the site down. In the absence of options to target the site directly, they ask third-party intermediaries such as Google to lend a hand.\n749 Million URLs\nGoogle and other major search engines allow rightsholders to request removal of allegedly infringing URLs. The aim is to ensure that pirate sites no longer show up in search results when people search for books, movies, music, or other copyrighted content.\nThe Pirate Bay, for example, has been a popular target; Google has removed more than 4.2 million thepiratebay.org URLs over the years in response to copyright holder complaints. While this sounds like a sizable number, it pales in comparison to the volume of takedowns targeting Anna’s Archive.\nGoogle’s transparency report reveals that rightsholders asked Google to remove 784 million URLs, divided over the three main Anna’s Archive domains. A small number were rejected, mainly because Google didn’t index the reported links, resulting in 749 million confirmed removals.\nThe comparison to sites such as The Pirate Bay isn’t fair, as Anna’s Archive has many more pages in its archive and uses multiple country-specific subdomains. This means that there’s simply more content to take down. That said, in terms of takedown activity, the site’s three domain names clearly dwarf all pirate competition.\n5% of All Google Takedowns, Ever\nSince Google published its first transparency report in May 2012, rightsholders have flagged 15.1 billion allegedly infringing URLs. That’s a staggering number, but the fact that 5% of the total targeted Anna’s Archive URLs is remarkable.\nPenguin Random House and John Wiley & Sons are the most active publishers targeting the site, but they are certainly not alone. According to Google data, more than 1,000 authors or publishers have sent DMCA notices targeting Anna’s Archive domains.\nYet, there appears to be no end in sight. Rightsholders are reporting roughly 10 million new URLs per week for the popular piracy library, so there is no shortage of content to report.\nWith these DMCA takedown notices, publishers are aiming to make it as difficult as possible for people to find books on the site using Google. This works, as many URLs are now delisted while others are actively being demoted by the search engine for book-related queries.\nThat said, the Anna’s Archive website is certainly not unfindable. Searching for the site’s name in Google still shows the main domain as the top search result.", "summary": "(summarizer_error: 401 Client Error: Unauthorized for url: https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions)"}

He described how the earth orbits around the sun and how the sun, in turn, orbits around the center of a vast collection of stars called our galaxy. At the end of the lecture, a little old lady at the back of the room got up and said: “What you have told us is rubbish. The world is really a flat plate supported on the back of a giant tortoise.” The scientist gave a superior smile before replying, “What is the tortoise standing on?” “You're very clever, young man, very clever,” said the old lady. “But it's turtles all the way down!”\nScientists today are pretty sure that the universe is not actually turtles all the way down, but we can create that kind of situation in other contexts. For example, here we have video monitors all the way down and set theory books all the way down, and shopping carts all the way down.\nAnd here's a computer storage equivalent:\nlook inside r.zip\n.\nIt's zip files all the way down:\neach one contains another zip file under the name r/r.zip\n.\n(For the die-hard Unix fans, r.tar.gz\nis\ngzipped tar files all the way down.)\nLike the line of shopping carts, it never ends,\nbecause it loops back onto itself: the zip file contains itself!\nAnd it's probably less work to put together a self-reproducing zip file\nthan to put together all those shopping carts,\nat least if you're the kind of person who would read this blog.\nThis post explains how.\nBefore we get to self-reproducing zip files, though, we need to take a brief detour into self-reproducing programs.\nSelf-reproducing programs\nThe idea of self-reproducing programs dates back to the 1960s. My favorite statement of the problem is the one Ken Thompson gave in his 1983 Turing Award address:\nIn college, before video games, we would amuse ourselves by posing programming exercises. One of the favorites was to write the shortest self-reproducing program. Since this is an exercise divorced from reality, the usual vehicle was FORTRAN. Actually, FORTRAN was the language of choice for the same reason that three-legged races are popular.\nMore precisely stated, the problem is to write a source program that, when compiled and executed, will produce as output an exact copy of its source. If you have never done this, I urge you to try it on your own. The discovery of how to do it is a revelation that far surpasses any benefit obtained by being told how to do it. The part about “shortest” was just an incentive to demonstrate skill and determine a winner.\nSpoiler alert! I agree: if you have never done this, I urge you to try it on your own. The internet makes it so easy to look things up that it's refreshing to discover something yourself once in a while. Go ahead and spend a few days figuring out. This blog will still be here when you get back. (If you don't mind the spoilers, the entire Turing award address is worth reading.)\n(Spoiler blocker.)\nhttp://www.robertwechsler.com/projects.html\nLet's try to write a Python program that prints itself.\nIt will probably be a print\nstatement, so here's a first attempt,\nrun at the interpreter prompt:\n>>> print 'hello'\nhello\nThat didn't quite work. But now we know what the program is, so let's print it:\n>>> print \"print 'hello'\"\nprint 'hello'\nThat didn't quite work either. The problem is that when you execute a simple print statement, it only prints part of itself: the argument to the print. We need a way to print the rest of the program too.\nThe trick is to use recursion: you write a string that is the whole program, but with itself missing, and then you plug it into itself before passing it to print.\n>>> s = 'print %s'; print s % repr(s)\nprint 'print %s'\nNot quite, but closer: the problem is that the string s\nisn't actually\nthe program. But now we know the general form of the program:\ns = '%s'; print s % repr(s)\n.\nThat's the string to use.\n>>> s = 's = %s; print s %% repr(s)'; print s % repr(s)\ns = 's = %s; print s %% repr(s)'; print s % repr(s)\nRecursion for the win.\nThis form of self-reproducing program is often called a quine, in honor of the philosopher and logician W. V. O. Quine, who discovered the paradoxical sentence:\n“Yields falsehood when preceded by its quotation”\nyields falsehood when preceded by its quotation.\nThe simplest English form of a self-reproducing quine is a command like:\nPrint this, followed by its quotation:\n“Print this, followed by its quotation:”\nThere's nothing particularly special about Python that makes quining possible. The most elegant quine I know is a Scheme program that is a direct, if somewhat inscrutable, translation of that sentiment:\n((lambda (x) `(,x ',x)) '(lambda (x) `(,x ',x)))\nI think the Go version is a clearer translation, at least as far as the quoting is concerned:\n/* Go quine */ package main import \"fmt\" func main() { fmt.Printf(\"%s%c%s%c\\n\", q, 0x60, q, 0x60) } var q = `/* Go quine */ package main import \"fmt\" func main() { fmt.Printf(\"%s%c%s%c\\n\", q, 0x60, q, 0x60) } var q = `\n(I've colored the data literals green throughout to make it clear what is program and what is data.)\nThe Go program has the interesting property that, ignoring the pesky newline\nat the end, the entire program is the same thing twice (/* Go quine */ ... q = `\n).\nThat got me thinking: maybe it's possible to write a self-reproducing program\nusing only a repetition operator.\nAnd you know what programming language has essentially only a repetition operator?\nThe language used to encode Lempel-Ziv compressed files\nlike the ones used by gzip\nand zip\n.\nSelf-reproducing Lempel-Ziv programs\nLempel-Ziv compressed data is a stream of instructions with two basic\nopcodes: literal(\nn)\nfollowed by\nn bytes of data means write those n bytes into the\ndecompressed output,\nand repeat(\nd,\nn)\nmeans look backward d bytes from the current location\nin the decompressed output and copy the n bytes you find there\ninto the output stream.\nThe programming exercise, then, is this: write a Lempel-Ziv program\nusing just those two opcodes that prints itself when run.\nIn other words, write a compressed data stream that decompresses to itself.\nFeel free to assume any reasonable encoding for the literal\nand repeat\nopcodes.\nFor the grand prize, find a program that decompresses to\nitself surrounded by an arbitrary prefix and suffix,\nso that the sequence could be embedded in an actual gzip\nor zip\nfile, which has a fixed-format header and trailer.\nSpoiler alert! I urge you to try this on your own before continuing to read. It's a great way to spend a lazy afternoon, and you have one critical advantage that I didn't: you know there is a solution.\n(Spoiler blocker.)\nhttp://www.robertwechsler.com/thebest.html\nBy the way, here's r.gz\n, gzip files all the way down.\n$ gunzip < r.gz > r $ cmp r r.gz $\nThe nice thing about r.gz\nis that even broken web browsers\nthat ordinarily decompress downloaded gzip data before storing it to disk\nwill handle this file correctly!\nEnough stalling to hide the spoilers.\nLet's use this shorthand to describe Lempel-Ziv instructions:\nL\nn and R\nn are\nshorthand for literal(\nn)\nand\nrepeat(\nn,\nn)\n,\nand the program assumes that each code is one byte.\nL0\nis therefore the Lempel-Ziv no-op;\nL5\nhello\nprints hello\n;\nand so does L3\nhel\nR1\nL1\no\n.\nHere's a Lempel-Ziv program that prints itself. (Each line is one instruction.)\n| Code | Output | |||\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| no-op | L0 | |||\n| no-op | L0 | |||\n| no-op | L0 | |||\n| print 4 bytes | L4 L0 L0 L0 L4 | L0 L0 L0 L4 | ||\n| repeat last 4 printed bytes | R4 | L0 L0 L0 L4 | ||\n| print 4 bytes | L4 R4 L4 R4 L4 | R4 L4 R4 L4 | ||\n| repeat last 4 printed bytes | R4 | R4 L4 R4 L4 | ||\n| print 4 bytes | L4 L0 L0 L0 L0 | L0 L0 L0 L0 |\n(The two columns Code and Output contain the same byte sequence.)\nThe interesting core of this program is the 6-byte sequence\nL4 R4 L4 R4 L4 R4\n, which prints the 8-byte sequence R4 L4 R4 L4 R4 L4 R4 L4\n.\nThat is, it prints itself with an extra byte before and after.\nWhen we were trying to write the self-reproducing Python program,\nthe basic problem was that the print statement was always longer\nthan what it printed. We solved that problem with recursion,\ncomputing the string to print by plugging it into itself.\nHere we took a different approach.\nThe Lempel-Ziv program is\nparticularly repetitive, so that a repeated substring ends up\ncontaining the entire fragment. The recursion is in the\nrepresentation of the program rather than its execution.\nEither way, that fragment is the crucial point.\nBefore the final R4\n, the output lags behind the input.\nOnce it executes, the output is one code ahead.\nThe L0\nno-ops are plugged into\na more general variant of the program, which can reproduce itself\nwith the addition of an arbitrary three-byte prefix and suffix:\n| Code | Output | |||\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| print 4 bytes | L4 aa bb cc L4 | aa bb cc L4 | ||\n| repeat last 4 printed bytes | R4 | aa bb cc L4 | ||\n| print 4 bytes | L4 R4 L4 R4 L4 | R4 L4 R4 L4 | ||\n| repeat last 4 printed bytes | R4 | R4 L4 R4 L4 | ||\n| print 4 bytes | L4 R4 xx yy zz | R4 xx yy zz | ||\n| repeat last 4 printed bytes | R4 | R4 xx yy zz |\n(The byte sequence in the Output column is aa bb cc\n, then\nthe byte sequence from the Code column, then xx yy zz\n.)\nIt took me the better part of a quiet Sunday to get this far,\nbut by the time I got here I knew the game was over\nand that I'd won.\nFrom all that experimenting, I knew it was easy to create\na program fragment that printed itself minus a few instructions\nor even one that printed an arbitrary prefix\nand then itself, minus a few instructions.\nThe extra aa bb cc\nin the output\nprovides a place to attach such a program fragment.\nSimilarly, it's easy to create a fragment to attach\nto the xx yy zz\nthat prints itself,\nminus the first three instructions, plus an arbitrary suffix.\nWe can use that generality to attach an appropriate\nheader and trailer.\nHere is the final program, which prints itself surrounded by an\narbitrary prefix and suffix.\n[P]\ndenotes the p-byte compressed form of the prefix P\n;\nsimilarly, [S]\ndenotes the s-byte compressed form of the suffix S\n.\n| Code | Output | |||\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| print prefix | [P] |\nP |\n||\n| print p+1 bytes | L p+1 [P] L p+1\n|\n[P] L p+1\n|\n||\n| repeat last p+1 printed bytes | R p+1\n|\n[P] L p+1\n|\n||\n| print 1 byte | L1 R p+1\n|\nR p+1\n|\n||\n| print 1 byte | L1 L1 |\nL1 |\n||\n| print 4 bytes | L4 R p+1 L1 L1 L4 |\nR p+1 L1 L1 L4 |\n||\n| repeat last 4 printed bytes | R4 |\nR p+1 L1 L1 L4 |\n||\n| print 4 bytes | L4 R4 L4 R4 L4 |\nR4 L4 R4 L4 |\n||\n| repeat last 4 printed bytes | R4 |\nR4 L4 R4 L4 |\n||\n| print 4 bytes | L4 R4 L0 L0 L s+1\n|\nR4 L0 L0 L s+1\n|\n||\n| repeat last 4 printed bytes | R4 |\nR4 L0 L0 L s+1\n|\n||\n| no-op | L0 |\n|||\n| no-op | L0 |\n|||\n| print s+1 bytes | L s+1 R s+1 [S] |\nR s+1 [S] |\n||\n| repeat last s+1 bytes | R s+1\n|\nR s+1 [S] |\n||\n| print suffix | [S] |\nS |\n(The byte sequence in the Output column is P\n, then\nthe byte sequence from the Code column, then S\n.)\nSelf-reproducing zip files\nNow the rubber meets the road. We've solved the main theoretical obstacle to making a self-reproducing zip file, but there are a couple practical obstacles still in our way.\nThe first obstacle is to translate our self-reproducing Lempel-Ziv program, written in simplified opcodes, into the real opcode encoding. RFC 1951 describes the DEFLATE format used in both gzip and zip: a sequence of blocks, each of which is a sequence of opcodes encoded using Huffman codes. Huffman codes assign different length bit strings to different opcodes, breaking our assumption above that opcodes have fixed length. But wait! We can, with some care, find a set of fixed-size encodings that says what we need to be able to express.\nIn DEFLATE, there are literal blocks and opcode blocks. The header at the beginning of a literal block is 5 bytes:\nIf the translation of our L\nopcodes above\nare 5 bytes each, the translation of the R\nopcodes\nmust also be 5 bytes each, with all the byte counts\nabove scaled by a factor of 5.\n(For example, L4\nnow has a 20-byte argument,\nand R4\nrepeats the last 20 bytes of output.)\nThe opcode block\nwith a single repeat(20,20)\ninstruction falls well short of\n5 bytes:\nLuckily, an opcode block containing two\nrepeat(20,10)\ninstructions has the same effect and is exactly 5 bytes:\nEncoding the other sized repeats\n(R\np+1 and\nR\ns+1)\ntakes more effort\nand some sleazy tricks, but it turns out that\nwe can design 5-byte codes that repeat any amount\nfrom 9 to 64 bytes.\nFor example, here are the repeat blocks for 10 bytes and for 40 bytes:\nThe repeat block for 10 bytes is two bits too short, but every repeat block is followed by a literal block, which starts with three zero bits and then padding to the next byte boundary. If a repeat block ends two bits short of a byte but is followed by a literal block, the literal block's padding will insert the extra two bits. Similarly, the repeat block for 40 bytes is five bits too long, but they're all zero bits. Starting a literal block five bits too late steals the bits from the padding. Both of these tricks only work because the last 7 bits of any repeat block are zero and the bits in the first byte of any literal block are also zero, so the boundary isn't directly visible. If the literal block started with a one bit, this sleazy trick wouldn't work.\nThe second obstacle is that zip archives (and gzip files) record a CRC32 checksum of the uncompressed data. Since the uncompressed data is the zip archive, the data being checksummed includes the checksum itself. So we need to find a value x such that writing x into the checksum field causes the file to checksum to x. Recursion strikes back.\nThe CRC32 checksum computation interprets the entire file as a big number and computes the remainder when you divide that number by a specific constant using a specific kind of division. We could go through the effort of setting up the appropriate equations and solving for x. But frankly, we've already solved one nasty recursive puzzle today, and enough is enough. There are only four billion possibilities for x: we can write a program to try each in turn, until it finds one that works.\nIf you want to recreate these files yourself, there are a\nfew more minor obstacles, like making sure the tar file is a multiple\nof 512 bytes and compressing the rather large zip trailer to\nat most 59 bytes so that R\ns+1 is\nat most R\n64.\nBut they're just a simple matter of programming.\nSo there you have it:\nr.gz\n(gzip files all the way down),\nr.tar.gz\n(gzipped tar files all the way down),\nand\nr.zip\n(zip files all the way down).\nI regret that I have been unable to find any programs\nthat insist on decompressing these files recursively, ad infinitum.\nIt would have been fun to watch them squirm, but\nit looks like much less sophisticated\nzip bombs have spoiled the fun.\nIf you're feeling particularly ambitious, here is rgzip.go, the Go program that generated these files. I wonder if you can create a zip file that contains a gzipped tar file that contains the original zip file. Ken Thompson suggested trying to make a zip file that contains a slightly larger copy of itself, recursively, so that as you dive down the chain of zip files each one gets a little bigger. (If you do manage either of these, please leave a comment.)\nP.S.

And by modifying these 4 bytes you can make the CRC to be anything.\nSo, you first chose your CRC (for example to be 0x00000000), create your self-reproducing archive, and finally chose that 4 bytes so that CRC is what you want it to be. Thus, avoiding the recursive problem altogether.\n-\nk5 user (March 25, 2010 11:54 AM) Late for the game, but recursive zips have been around a very very long time. The anti-virus world has known about them for at least 8 years. One could create a denial of service attack against an AV product that was set to scan compressed files by sending in a zip of death. To combat this, many AV programs stop processing after some configurable \"depth\" into the file.\n-\nMisi (March 27, 2010 9:12 AM) So, here's what I was talking about:\nrec_fix.gz\nIt is a gzip quine, in which the bytes 102-105 are \"fix points\". That is, you can change them to whatever you want and the file will still uncompress to itself. (Of course, if you change them the CRC won't check out.)\nSo, I created this file with CRC in gzip footer set to all 0, and then \"reverse computed\" the CRC in these four bytes, so that the CRC of the whole file is actually 0. I believe, that based on this idea it is possible to create a file that has a part in the middle, which duplicate itself on gunzipping, while the CRC stays the same. I will post it here when I'm finished.\nYou also might want to look inside this file, as it is based on slightly different idea than yours. For example, I do not depend on \"repeat\" opcodes being 5 bytes. There's a \"source code\" which might be slightly easier to read: rec_fix.lgz\n-\nMisi (March 27, 2010 3:47 PM) Here it is: rec_exp.gz.\nIt has a 32 bytes block which duplicates on uncompressing, and the CRC is always correct (and 0).\nUnfortunately, the gzip footer also contains a size field, which of course won't be correct... Until you uncompress the file 27 times. :) At that point the size of the duplicating block will become 4 gigabytes and the 32 bit size field is set to be the remainder. (I didn't check this though. :))\nWhile thinking about this, I realized that there is a much simpler (but somewhat cheating) way of creating a \"growing gzip quine\". You just duplicate the whole file. As gzip just concatenates the output of concatenated inputs, this will work without paying much attention to size or crc fields. So, here is a file for which gunzipping is the same as concatenating it with itself: rec_dup.gz\n(The \"sources\" are available in the same directory.)\n-\nMarc Ruef (May 1, 2010 1:57 AM) Hello,\nVery interesting research and a great writeup!

Finally, the act\nof representing the representation (executing the 'print' instruction)\nmakes the representation real (a new program, identical to its\nparent). There's no representation of a cart in circle of carts.\nOther artistic context have the potentiality of making quines, as they\nblur the boundary between reality and its representation. I'm thinking\nabout some of Escher's drawings, Pirandello's \"six characters in\nsearch of an author\", or Allen's \"Purple Rose of Cairo\".\nHowever none of them is a quine, because the artistic work does not\nrepresent itself (e.g.\"Purple Rose of Cairo\"'s representation is a\nmovie about egypt, rather than a Great Depression story).\nThe example that gets closer to a real quine (probably by accident) is\n\"The 13th floor\".

As for the C versions, some of them have the problem of non compliance of the C standard (say, no int for main's return type). Another example is the implicit declaration of printf (no #include <stdio.h>)\nSo I fixed that stuff too (hopefully it pastes ok):\n#include <stdio.h>\nint main(){ char*p=\"#include <stdio.h>%cint main(){ char*p=%c%s%c; printf(p,10,34,p,34,10,10); return 0; %c}%c\"; printf(p,10,34,p,34,10,10); return 0;\n}\nwc ran on that source file, for what its worth :\n3 16 173 quine2.c\n(For windows folks, that means : 3 lines, 16 words, 173 characters)\nAs for the person who tried it in php and included the file directly, indeed the point is very different.

Its not hard coded. So its not really flawed. The fact is that there's some things that will be hard to find out if it's ok or not on first look (and some av's may report it ok when others not, and so on). Even antidebugging tricks can make an antivirus detection engine think its malware when its not. Of course, the more 'scary' trick was piggybacking - that's when the malware would infect files/whatever as the av engine was scanning them.\nStill, false positives are just as bad as a false negatives (another similar thing - badly configured firewalls can be really bad) when it comes to security. That's just how it goes, and we all have to make the best of it some times. Of course, if a file is zipped up many times it may bring about suspicion, and perhaps it should. What do they have to hide? So in the end it is a matter of using some common sense, understanding how things work, and antiviruses along with it does a pretty good job if all work together.\n-\nDavid Wagner (January 28, 2012 10:10 PM) This is awesome! Thank you for posting this puzzle.\nI had fun looking at the simplified version, where you are only allowed Ln and Rn opcodes (Rn,m not allowed). I was curious what was the shortest quine.\nFor fun, I decided to throw a SAT solver at it. Here's what I found. The shortest quine is 16 bytes long:\nL0 L0 L0 L2 L0 L0 L2 L0 L2 R3 R2 L2 R3 R2 R3 R2\nOr, in parsed form:\nL0\nL0\nL0\nL2 L0 L0\nL2 L0 L2\nR3\nR2\nL2 R3 R2\nR3\nR2\nAssuming my SAT code is correct, there is no shorter quine. There is also no quine of length 17. However, there appear to be quines of all larger lengths.\nIf you're curious how I encoded this as SAT, here's the approach I took to search for a quine of length n:\nI defined a n-byte array of unknowns, call it In, so In(i) is the ith byte of the input. (We'll add constraints to force it to also be the ith byte of the output.)\nThen, I defined a (n+1) x (n+1) array of boolean unknowns, active(.,.), where\nactive(i,j) is true if In(0..i-1) is a well-parsed sequence of bytes (i.e., it doesn't end in the middle of an unfinished string literal) and decompressing In(0..i-1) produces the output In(0..j-1).\nIt is not too difficult to write down a set of constraints that define the entries of active(.,.) in terms of the entries of In(.). I then emit constraints to require active(0,0) be true, and to require that active(n, n) be true. I then invoke the SAT solver to find a solution that respects all of these constraints.\nThis was fun!

The paper uses the Same Generation (SG)\nrelation as an example:\n1: SG(x, y) <- Edge(p, x), Edge(p, y), x != y\n2: SG(x, y) <- Edge(a, x), SG(a, b), Edge(b, y), x != y\nRule 1 states that two vertices (x\nand y\n) are part of the same generation if they both share a common ancestor (p\n), and they are not actually the same vertex (x != y\n).\nRule 2 states that two vertices (x\nand y\n) are part of the same generation if they have ancestors (a\nand b\n) from the same generation.\n“Running a Datalog program” entails evaluating all rules until a fixed point is reached (no more tuples are added).\nSemi-naïve Evaluation\nOne key idea to internalize is that evaluating a Datalog rule is equivalent to performing a SQL join. For example, rule 1 is equivalent to joining the Edge\nrelation with itself, using p\nas the join key, and (x != y)\nas a filter.\nSemi-naïve Evaluation is an algorithm for performing these joins until convergence, while not wasting too much effort on redundant work.

It seems to me like this data structure would work well on other chips too. Fig. 2 illustrates the data structure (join keys are in red):\nThe data array holds the actual tuple data. It is densely packed in row-major order.\nThe sorted index array holds pointers into the data array (one pointer per tuple). These pointers are lexicographically sorted (join keys take higher priority in the sort).\nThe hash table is an open-addressed hash table which maps a hash of the join keys to the first element in the sorted index array that contains those join keys.\nA join of relations A and B\n, can be implemented with the following pseudo-code:\nfor each tuple 'a' in the sorted index array of A:\nlookup (hash table) the first tuple in B which has matching join keys to 'a'\niterate over all tuples in the sorted index array of B with matching keys\nMemory accesses when probing through the sorted index array are coherent.

{"theme": "tech", "title": "Bloom filters are good for search that does not scale", "url": "https://notpeerreviewed.com/blog/bloom-filters/", "published": "2025-11-04T09:25:31+00:00", "cleaned_text": "A great blog post from 2013 describes using bloom filters to build a space-efficient full text search index for small numbers of documents. The algorithm is simple: Per document, create a bloom filter of all its words. To query, simply check each document's bloom filter for the query terms.\nWith a query time complexity of O(number-of-documents), we can forget about using this on big corpuses, right? In this blog post I propose a way of scaling the technique to large document corpuses (e.g. the web) and discuss why that is a bad idea.\nFun fact: There is a nice implementation of this exact algorithm that is still used in the wild. But let's get into it.\nWhy even try this?\nThe bloom filter index's big selling point is its small size. It allows static websites with dozens of pages to ship a full text search index to the client that is as small as a small image. An equivalent inverted index, which is the traditional textbook approach for keyword-based full text search, would be multiple times bigger.\nBut index size is not only relevant on small blog websites. If we could scale this technique to larger document corpuses and achive similar space savings, that would be huge!\nThe main thing that seems to stand in our way is query performance. Instead of always checking every document's bloom filter, we will try to construct an index that only checks a small subset of filters, but still finds all matching documents.\nSome Ideas that don't work at all\nLook, I brainstormed a bunch of ideas for how to improve the bloom filter based index. I will quickly go over two of them, because identifying and discarding ideas that will not work is an important part of science and engineering.\nSort the filters\nIf we sort the filters by some metric, for example by the most to least significant bits, then we can use a binary search algorithm or something like that, right? - Wrong.\nWe can construct a simple counter example to show that this does not work. Here the query is matched by the first and the last filter in a sorted list of filters.\nTree of filters\nPlain sorting does not work, but what if we structure our big set of filters into a tree? Imagine it sort of like this, but much bigger.\nAt each branch node, we construct an aggregate filter that encodes all documents that are reachable from the branch. Aggregate filters are constructed by a simple bitwise or of the other filters like this.\nWhen we get a query, we first check it against the top level branch filters. If a filter does not match e.g. the filter for document 6-10, we can discard that entire branch of the tree for this query.\nIdeally we would like to search as few branches of the tree as possible to improve performance. How many branches we do need to search, depends heavily on the partitioning of the documents. Intuitively, we can think of it like this: branch A should contain all documents that contain the words \"dog\", \"cat\", \"bird\". Branch B should contain documents with \"car\", \"bus\", \"plane\". The fewer branches each word is contained in the better.\nHere comes the problem: What if there is a document that says \"I took my cat on the bus today\"?\nThis breaks our assumtion above, and suddenly for the query \"bus\" we need to search both branches.\nYou can imagine this happening for almost every word in the dicionary across all branches, because language is complex\nand lets us say so many different things in many different contexts.\nOr in other words: Text documents are high-dimensional.\nI recommend reading about the curse of dimensionality for an intuition of what issues this implies.\nHere it means that it is basically impossible to cluster text documents into\ndisjunct subsets without significant overlap.\nFor our seach index that means that even when using this tree, we would still need to search almost every\ndocument for every query.\nInverted Index of Bloom Filters\nThe problem with our previous tree-based idea is that there is so much overlap between text documents. But I know one book that only contains every word exactly once: The dictionary. We can construct a search tree of the entire dictionary, again based on bloom filters. Each leaf represents a set of words. At each leaf we keep a list of pointers to every document's filter that contains one of those words.\nMaybe not so incidentally, this looks a lot like an inverted index. And it works! For any query term we can walk the tree to the leaf that contains the query term and then we match only against the filters at that leaf. Instead of a hash table, as in the inverted index, our index uses a tree for the dictionary, but fundamentally it does a similar thing.\nThe big difference is that the tree can be smaller than the hash table. Remember, size is the main reason to attempt this at all. Not only is there no empty space in a tree, but we also encode all the words in our bloom filters instead of storing them outright. Modern bloom filters (actually called Xor filters) require about ten bits per element [1], much less than the 8 bits per character required to store a full word.\nAs an aside, bloom filters are indeed already used in full text search for large-ish datasets, but in the form of skip-indexes. In a skip index, a bloom filter is used to quickly check if a large chunk of data contains a value (e.g. a word) at all. That way, a database can avoid reading chunks of data that do not contain any records for a given query. Until very recently this technique was used by the Clickhouse OLAP system for full text search [2]. It has been superseeded by a proper inverted index in 2025.\nWhy all of this is still a bad idea\nWe did it! We have a working idea for a bloom filter based search index that works for large document corpuses. The query time complexity is not as good as for an inverted index, but it is logarithmic with the number of documents. That is good enough if you ask me. So why do I write that it is still a bad idea?\nLet's think about what allows the bloom filter based index to be small again. Instead of storing the entire dictionary in our index, we use bloom filters that require about ten bits per word. Ten bits per word. Ten bits per every word. Not unique word. Every word in our document corpus (except duplicates in the same document). To make our math exceedingly simple, let's say the english dictionary has about 500 Thousand unique words and every document contains 1000 distinct words. At ten bits per entry for a bloom filter, that makes each document's filter about 1.25kb. Assume that words are on average ten characters long, then the dictionary will require 5mb for the text alone. We can assume another 4mb for the inverted index's hash table to get a lower bound of 9mb for the inverted index. Both indexes require similar amounts of space for document ids and pointers, so relative to the inverted index, our bloom filter index grows by 1.25kb per document. Divide 9mb by 1.25kb and you find out that at only 7200 documents the inverted index becomes more space efficient than the bloom filter index. Of course the real numbers will be different and we are ignoring some things here, but the trend will stay the same.\nWhat is going on here is that while an inverted index must store every word in the dictionary exactly once, sharing the space when a word is reused, bloom filters do not share space amongst each other. Every document's bloom filter must encode all words in the document from scratch. If a word is contained in thousands of documents, that requires much more space than simply storing the word in plain text.\nConclusions\nWhen you have a small number of documents relative to the size of your dictionary, bloom filters can indeed achieve a much smaller full text search index than is possible traditionally.\nBloom filters are space efficient when compressing a large dictionary into a small number of filters. As more filters share the same dictionary, this efficiency decreases. Intuitively this is because bloom filters cannot share information amongst each other. Each filter must encode its entire dictionary from scratch. An inverted index does not do this. It only stores the dictionary once and shares it for all documents, so it gets more space efficient with the number of documents.\nMore generally, there is no synergy between bloom filters. Each filter on its own is efficient, but as a whole system, a different approach might be more efficient. We can transfer this insight to other problem domains as well. For example, imagine a content moderation system on a social media platform that allows blocking individual accounts. If we have one global blocklist on our platform, a bloom filter can be an efficient (though maybe not ideal) implementation of this. But allow every user to create their own blocklist and a different design will be more scaleable.", "summary": "(summarizer_error: 401 Client Error: Unauthorized for url: https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions)"}

When you debug minified JavaScript in your browser's DevTools and see the original source with proper variable names and formatting, you're witnessing source maps in action.\nFor example, when your browser encounters an error at bundle.min.js:1:27698\n, the source map translates this to src/index.ts:73:16\n, revealing exactly where the issue occurred in your original TypeScript code:\nBut how does this actually work under the hood? In this post, we'll take a deep dive into the internals of source maps, exploring their format, encoding mechanisms, and how devtools use them to bridge the gap between production code and developer-friendly sources.\nThe TypeScript Build Pipeline\nModern JavaScript builds typically involve three main stages:\n- Transpilation: TypeScript → JavaScript\n- Bundling: Combining modules into a single file\n- Minification: Compressing code for production\nAt each stage, source maps preserve the connection back to the original code.\nStage 0: Source TS files\nThe original TypeScript source files with full type annotations.\nSource Files\n1export function add(a: number, b: number): number {2 return a + b;3}\n1import { add } from './add';23export function computeFibonacci(n: number): number {4 if (n <= 1) return n;5 return add(computeFibonacci(n - 1), computeFibonacci(n - 2));6}\n1import { computeFibonacci } from './fibonacci';23const result = computeFibonacci(10);4console.log(`Fibonacci(10) = ${result}`);\nNo source map at this stage\nThe Source Map File Format\nSource maps use JSON format, typically with a .js.map\nextension. Let's examine a source map structure from our add.js.map\nfile:\n{\n\"version\": 3,\n\"file\": \"add.js\",\n\"sourceRoot\": \"\",\n\"sources\": [\"add.ts\"],\n\"names\": [\"add\", \"a\", \"b\"],\n\"mappings\": \"AAAA,OAAO,SAAS,IAAI,CAAC,EAAE;EACrB,OAAO,IAAI;AACb\"\n}\nFields Breakdown:\nversion\n: Indicates the source map version (currently always3\n).file\n: The generated file name this source map corresponds to.sourceRoot\n: Optional prefix for all source URLs. Useful when sources are hosted elsewhere.sources\n: Array of original source file paths from which the generated file was built.sourcesContent\n: Optional array containing the actual source code. This allows DevTools to display sources even if the original files aren't accessible. Usually disabled in production builds.names\n: Array of original identifiers (variable names, function names, etc.) that appear in the source. Referenced by the mappings.mappings\n: The compressed mapping data. This is the heart of the source map and uses VLQ encoding. More on this below.\nUnderstanding the Mappings: VLQ Encoding\nThe mappings\nfield is where the real magic happens. It contains the actual position mappings between every token in the generated JavaScript file and its corresponding location in the original source files.\nEssentially, it answers the question: \"For this character at line X, column Y in the minified file, where was it originally located?\"\nThis mapping data tracks:\n- The file path and name of the original source file\n- The exact line and column in the source file\n- The original variable/function name (if renamed during minification)\nBut instead of storing this as a massive JSON array of positions, which would be larger than the minified code itself, source maps use a highly compressed format. Here's what the encoded string looks like:\n\"AAAA,OAAO,SAAS,IAAI,CAAC,EAAE;EACrB,OAAO,IAAI;AACb\"\nTo keep file sizes manageable, mappings use Variable Length Quantity (VLQ) encoding with Base64 characters. Let's break this down.\nThe Mapping Structure\nThe mappings string is a series of segments separated by commas and semicolons:\n\"segment,segment,segment;segment,segment;segment\"\nWe'll see significance of commas and semicolons shortly, but first, what is a \"segment\"?\nEach segment represents a mapping from a position in the generated file to a position in the source file. Segments come in three flavors:\n-\n1 value: This referenced column doesn't map to any source (e.g., webpack-generated code)\n[generatedColumn]\n-\n4 values: This is the most common case, mapping a position in the generated file to a position in the source file:\n[generatedColumn, sourceFileIndex, sourceLine, sourceColumn]\n-\n5 values: Same as 4, plus a reference to the original name of the variable/function:\n[generatedColumn, sourceFileIndex, sourceLine, sourceColumn, nameIndex]\nThe most common case is 4 values (basic position mapping). The 5th value is only added when a variable or function was renamed during minification.\nBut wait, notice that segments only contain the column in the generated file, not the line number. How does the decoder know which line a segment belongs to?\nThe answer lies in the structure: semicolons act as line breaks. The position of segments between semicolons determines their line number in the generated file.\nThis is why empty lines in the generated file still need semicolons, they maintain the line count even with no mappings.\nLet's see how this works with a real example:\nNotice how the decoded values give relative positions, each value represents the difference from the previous position, not absolute coordinates. This is crucial: instead of encoding large column numbers like 27698 in minified files, source maps only store small deltas like +7 or +15, making the encoded strings much more compact.\nNow that we understand the mapping structure, let's see how these numbers actually get transformed into the Base64 alphabet characters we see in the mappings string.\nHow VLQ Encoding Works\nVLQ (Variable Length Quantity) encoding is an efficient way to represent numbers using as few bytes as possible. It's perfect for source maps because most position differences are small numbers.\nThe encoding process has three main steps:\n1. Encode the sign bit\nSince we need to handle both positive and negative differences (code can move backward), VLQ uses the least significant bit (LSB) to encode the sign:\nPositive number: LSB = 0\nNegative number: LSB = 1\nExamples:\n5 → binary: 101 → with sign bit: 1010 (LSB=0 for positive)\n-5 → binary: 101 → with sign bit: 1011 (LSB=1 for negative)\n2. Split into 5-bit groups\nEach Base64 character can represent 6 bits, but we need 1 bit as a \"continuation\" flag to indicate if more characters follow. This leaves 5 bits for data:\n[continuation bit][5 data bits]\n↑ ↑\n1 = more coming actual value bits\n0 = last character\n3. Convert to Base64\nMap each 6-bit value to a Base64 character:\nA=0, B=1, C=2... Z=25, a=26, b=27... z=51, 0=52, 1=53... 9=61, +=62, /=63\nExample\nLets go through the steps to encode the number 7:\nThat's why in our mapping example, the value 7 is encoded as 'O'!\nConclusion\nI hope this deep dive into JavaScript source maps has shed light on how they function under the hood and adds to your appreciation for the amount of position data they efficiently encode.\nP.S.

The 2027 pick going to the Jets will be the better of the Cowboys' two first-round picks that year.\nEarlier Tuesday, the Cowboys acquired linebacker Logan Wilson from the Cincinnati Bengals for a 2026 seventh-round pick.\n\"It's exciting. Kudos to Jerry and Stephen (Jones) and Will (McClay) and I think being aggressive but smart because (it's) a couple of the moves we made you're getting guys not just for this year, but beyond, which I think is great,\" coach Brian Schottenheimer said. \"It gets you excited as a coach and I think it's two terrific players, but also terrific young men.\"\nThe Cowboys had discussions with the Jets regarding Williams in a potential trade for Micah Parsons before the season started, but they were told New York did not have the resources to sign Parsons to a mega-contract. Two months later, the Cowboys have Kenny Clark, who was acquired from the Green Bay Packers along with two first-round picks for Parsons, and Williams at defensive tackle, along with Osa Odighizuwa, who was signed to an $80 million contract in March.\nHours before the deal for Williams, the Jets traded star cornerback Sauce Gardner to the Indianapolis Colts for 2026 and 2027 first-round selections and receiver AD Mitchell.\nWilliams, 28, was the third overall pick in the 2019 draft and was selected to the Pro Bowl for the 2021-23 seasons, which included time with current Cowboys defensive line coach Aaron Whitecotton. For his career, he has 40 sacks, and this season has been credited with 32 tackles, a sack, 3 forced fumbles and 3 quarterback hurries.\nHe also leads all defensive linemen with a 9.5% run stop percentage this season, according to ESPN Research.\nAccording to ESPN Research, Williams' 40 sacks since entering the NFL in 2019 ranks fifth among primary defensive tackles over that time, behind Chris Jones (58.5), Aaron Donald (51.5), DeForest Buckner (50.5) and Cameron Heyward (45).\nHe is signed through 2027 and is set to make $20.75 million -- with $5 million guaranteed -- next year and $25.4 million in 2027. Clark is also signed through 2027 and is due an $11 million roster bonus if he is on the roster the third day of the 2026 league year with an $8.8 million salary.\nWilliams wasn't happy with the direction of the Jets, sources told ESPN's Rich Cimini. When news broke in February that Aaron Rodgers was going to be released, Williams tweeted: \"Another rebuild year for me I guess.\" He later apologized for the tweet, expressing faith in the new regime.\nHope quickly faded, as the Jets lost their first seven games. Williams told people close to him that he was frustrated by the losing. This is his seventh year, and he has yet to experience a winning season. He also wasn't happy with the way he was being used on defense. He recorded a sack on the first defensive play of the season (against Rodgers) and hasn't made one since.\nWilliams' contract also loomed as a potential issue in the offseason for the Jets, as they expected him to demand a renegotiation that would've meant more guaranteed money. Instead of investing more money in him, they decided to be proactive in offloading him.\nHow the Cowboys incorporate the three defensive tackles into Matt Eberflus' scheme will be of note. However, the Cowboys showed more of a five-man front vs. the Arizona Cardinals on Monday that shifted Odighizuwa's positioning some.\nRun defense has been an issue for the Cowboys for years, and the team hoped the addition of Clark would solidify it. While Clark has held up, the Cowboys have allowed more than 80 yards rushing in each game and at least 119 yards on the ground in six of them.\nAfter Monday's 27-17 loss to the Cardinals, team owner and general manager Jerry Jones spoke of making deals to help the 2025 defense as well as for the future. It is the most significant trade deadline move the Cowboys have made since 2018, when they gave up a first-round pick to the Raiders for wide receiver Amari Cooper.\nThe Cowboys ended up winning seven of their final nine games to win the division and made it to the divisional round of the playoffs, with Cooper invigorating a passing game that had been dormant.\nIn order to make the playoffs this year, the trades for Williams and Wilson must do the same, but the team still has issues with its pass defense.\nThe Cowboys are on their bye this week and return to action Nov. 17 against the Raiders. Players were scheduled to report to The Star on Tuesday but will be off for the remainder of the week.\nWilliams is expected to arrive Wednesday.\nThe first time Williams and Wilson will take part in a full practice will be next week.\nESPN's Rich Cimini contributed to this report.", "summary": "(summarizer_error: 401 Client Error: Unauthorized for url: https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions)"}

And dealing.\nIn a watershed day for the franchise, Mougey traded defensive cornerstones Sauce Gardner and Quinnen Williams in separate blockbusters, essentially shifting the focus to 2026 and beyond.\n\"I wouldn't call it a teardown,\" Mougey said about two hours after the NFL trading deadline.\nThe Jets are 1-7, looking at their 15th straight non-playoff season, the league's longest active drought. Mougey, in his first season, said they aren't giving up on 2025.\n\"The goal is always to win,\" he said. \"Look, these coaches and players work too hard every day, all day, with the goal of winning on Sunday. And that never changes because that's what the fans deserve. That's what the players deserve, that's what the coaches deserve and that never changes.\"\nNevertheless, the trades were stunning.\nThe Jets traded Gardner to the Indianapolis Colts for two first-round picks (2026 and 2027) and wide receiver Adonai Mitchell. They dealt Williams to the Dallas Cowboys for a 2026 second-round pick, a 2027 first-round pick and defensive tackle Mazi Smith.\nThe Gardner deal was especially surprising, considering he signed a four-year, $120 million extension in July. What changed?\n\"Indianapolis kept getting richer and richer with their value, and eventually it was too good to pass up,\" said Mougey, adding that talks escalated over the past few days.\nThe Jets weren't shopping Gardner, sources said. They structured his contract in a way that would make him tradeable -- a manageable amount of up-front money, with rolling guarantees. Wide receiver Garrett Wilson's four-year, $130 million extension, also signed in July, was fashioned the same way.\n\"You never know how the future is going to unfold, and we always wanted to be in a position to potentially trade these contracts ... [in] case that you get into a situation where the value you think is just too good to pass up,\" Mougey said. \"And that happened to be the case here.\"\nThe Williams deal came together quicker than the Gardner deal. Williams, a three-time Pro Bowl tackle, was disgruntled with the direction of the franchise, sources said. Mougey declined to say if Williams requested a trade, adding, \"I'm not here to talk about rumors and different things.\"\nMougey said Williams' contract wasn't a factor in the decision. Williams is signed through 2027, though he has only $5 million in remaining guarantees and there was speculation that he was going to demand a new deal.\nCowboys owner Jerry Jones said in a September radio interview that he offered pass rusher Micah Parsons to the Jets for a deal that included Williams.\n\"I'll keep all those conversations that I had with the other teams private, but it came together and it was a good value for us,\" Mougey said.\nIn a span of a week, the Jets traded three defensive stalwarts - Gardner, Williams and nickel back Michael Carter II, all 28 and younger. Gardner and Williams have combined for five Pro Bowls and three All-Pro selections.\nThe upside is the Jets have two first-round picks in 2026 and three in 2027. Mougey said he's \"excited\" to have that flexibility.\nThe Jets conducted trade talks involving running back Breece Hall and edge rusher Jermaine Johnson, sources said, but decided to keep them. Hall will be a free agent after the season. Mougey declined to say whether they want to sign him.\n\"Through these processes, we talk about a lot of things and we field a lot of calls and we've got values, and Breece is a talented player,\" Mougey said. \"He's going to help us compete and win games the rest of the season. \"", "summary": "(summarizer_error: 401 Client Error: Unauthorized for url: https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions)"}

His propensity to give up home runs -- he allowed 23 in 161 innings -- caused his ERA to balloon to 4.64.\nHis return to Detroit helps stabilize the Tigers' rotation in an offseason of potentially seismic change. While the Tigers have no plans to trade soon-to-be two-time Cy Young Award winner Tarik Skubal, his impending free agency following the 2026 season will prompt teams to pursue potential trades over the winter, sources told ESPN.\nBeyond Skubal and Flaherty, the Tigers return right-hander Casey Mize, standout rookie Troy Melton and right-hander Reese Olson, who missed much of 2025 with a shoulder injury. Detroit, which used 36 pitchers and three position players on the mound this season, finished 87-75.\nFollowing a wild card series win over Cleveland -- which overtook Detroit in the final month of the season to capture the AL Central crown -- the Tigers were ousted in the division series by Seattle.\nFlaherty's first go-around in Detroit in 2024 was a smashing success, with a 2.95 ERA and 133 strikeouts against 19 walks in 106.2 innings. He was traded at the deadline to the Los Angeles Dodgers, for whom he started five postseason games en route to a World Series title.\nHe returned in free agency to Detroit on a two-year, $35 million contract. The deal paid Flaherty $25 million this year and included a second year for $10 million. When he passed the 15-start mark this season, the salary doubled.\nThe comfort Flaherty found with manager A.J. Hinch and pitching coaches Chris Fetter and Robin Lund hastened his desire to return. While Flaherty's fastball velocity has always been average, the growth across the sport rendered his 92.8 mph average in the 26th percentile among pitchers. Nonetheless, Flaherty's superior off-speed pitches allowed him to strike out 188 with 59 walks.\nOver a nine-year career, Flaherty is 63-56 with a 3.80 ERA and 1,130 strikeouts against 351 walks in 990⅔ innings.", "summary": "(summarizer_error: 401 Client Error: Unauthorized for url: https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions)"}

Gannon said he still doesn't know if Murray will be placed on injured reserve because of it.\nSources told ESPN's Adam Schefter that Murray and the team have consulted with multiple foot doctors about the injury and have been told a possible timetable for his recovery could be anywhere from four to eight weeks because of an increased likelihood of a setback unless it heals properly.\nAn eight-week timetable would take Murray through the Cardinals' Week 13 contest at the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on Nov. 30.\nGannon said Tuesday that injuries \"never\" go how you think they will.\n\"He's doing well. He wants to be out there,\" Gannon said of Murray. \"He's a competitor. I talked to him today, but he's a good teammate and he's working to get healthy.\"\nThe stats seem to back Gannon's assertion that the Cardinals' offense is playing better behind Brissett:\n• In his three starts, Brissett is averaging 286 passing yards per game and 7.7 yards per attempt, and he has thrown for six touchdowns with one interception. In his five starts, Murray is averaging 170 passing yards and 6.0 yards per attempt, and he has thrown for six touchdowns with three interceptions. Each has run for one touchdown, despite Murray rushing 14 more times for 122 more yards.\n• Arizona's offense is averaging 25.7 offensive points and 357 yards per game under Brissett as compared with 18.8 points and 288.4 yards under Murray.\n• Arizona also is converting 56% of third downs in Brissett starts and 40% in Murray starts.\n• Brissett has thrown for 44 first downs in two fewer games than Murray's 50 first downs.\nBrissett, however, said Monday night that the reason the offense is playing well is because \"all 11 are doing a good job.\"\n\"We're doing the things that are needed to move the ball, stay on the field and score points,\" Gannon said. \"And that's been good to see because we've put up some numbers here now that you would say that you should have a chance to win the game when you put up over what the points we've been putting up.\n\"So, with saying that, this week's going to be a new challenge. In my opinion, the tape that I've watched so far, this is the best defense that we have faced, so it'll be a big time challenge, especially at their place.\"", "summary": "(summarizer_error: 401 Client Error: Unauthorized for url: https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions)"}

Brown is a great player,\" Roseman said of the team captain on a videoconference with reporters. \"He wears a 'C' for a reason. He's an important part of this team, of this organization. He cares about winning, he cares about his teammates, and I think when you're a team like ours that is looking forward to an opportunity to compete for a championship, you just don't get rid of guys like that.\"\nBrown, 28, is averaging a career-low 56.4 receiving yards per game this season and has expressed frustration over the state of the Eagles' offense on multiple occasions.\nHe posted a photo to Instagram following a breakout two-touchdown performance against the Minnesota Vikings in mid-October with a caption reading, \"Using me but not using me,\" prompting speculation about whether it was directed at the team. Coach Nick Sirianni said, however, that it was \"business as usual\" inside the Eagles' building.\nBrown eclipsed 1,000 receiving yards in each of his three seasons in Philadelphia and has been a part of two teams that reached the Super Bowl, including last year's squad that won it all.\n\"I feel very lucky to have him on our team and excited about the second half of the season with him,\" Roseman said.\nThe Eagles made a flurry of moves prior to the deadline in an attempt to increase their chances of a repeat. They acquired:\nEdge Jaelan Phillips from the Miami Dolphins for a 2026 third-round pick\nCB Jaire Alexander and a seventh-round pick in 2027 from the Baltimore Ravens for a 2026 sixth-round pick\nDB Michael Carter II and a 2027 seventh-round pick from the New York Jets for WR John Metchie III and a 2027 sixth-round pick.\nThe Eagles' edge rush group lacked production over the first half of the season but should look much different now with Nolan Smith (triceps) nearing a return, Brandon Graham unretiring and the trade for Phillips.\n\"He can rush, he can set the edge, he can play in space. He's got a nonstop motor,\" Roseman said of Phillips.\n\"Obviously it's got to come together on the field, but I feel like we've got a really good front, and obviously adding Jaelan to that puts a lot of pieces in place to give us the opportunity to be dominant up front.\"\nPhillips played for Eagles defensive coordinator Vic Fangio when Fangio held the same post in Miami in 2023 and was in the midst of a career year before tearing his Achilles.\nRoseman said the familiarity with all three players -- senior personnel director Joe Douglas was the Jets' general manager when New York drafted Carter, and passing game coordinator/defensive backs coach Christian Parker was with Alexander in Green Bay in 2019-20 when Parker served as a defensive quality control coach -- allowed for greater comfort making these in-season moves.\nAlthough Phillips' role seems easy to project -- he should be near the top of the edge rush rotation immediately -- it's yet to be seen how Carter and Alexander fit into a group that is led by Cooper DeJean and Quinyon Mitchell but has struggled to solidify the third player in the CB puzzle.\n\"I think the first half of the season showed us how important cornerback depth is,\" said Roseman, who saw corners Mitchell, Jakorian Bennett, Adoree' Jackson and Kelee Ringo all deal with various injuries. Roseman added that Carter can also play safety, another position that could use some bolstering.\nRoseman said, \"We're not done here,\" with respect to the roster back in August and made true on that statement. He also acquired running back Tank Bigsby, Bennett, QB Sam Howell, OT Fred Johnson and Metchie in recent weeks.\n\"If there's an incremental difference in a player, we owe it to our team, to our fans, to our building, to our owner to do that,\" he said.", "summary": "(summarizer_error: 401 Client Error: Unauthorized for url: https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions)"}

With it comes inevitable questions, both obvious and arcane, about players, teams and, most importantly, what will happen 5½ months from now. Below are just some of what your intrepid ESPN Bracketologist will be watching in the 19 weeks between now and Selection Sunday.\nThe first in-season projections of the 2026 March Madness field of 68 will release Nov. 11.\n1. Who will secure the four No. 1 seeds on March 15?\nOur season-opening projection lists Houston, Purdue, Florida and Duke on the top line of the bracket. History suggests we'll be only half right, so I'm nominating Purdue and Florida as most likely to deceive. The reasons are that the Big Ten (in Purdue's case) and the SEC (in Florida's) have more contenders to chase the respective league favorites. Ultimately, Bracketology is a prisoner of probability, and it's simply more likely that Houston and Duke ride the wave of their respective conferences to a No. 1 seed.\n2. Who do we like in the emerging UConn-St. John's rivalry?\nThe Big East has needed a grudge match like this since the end of Villanova's hegemony in the conference. Both the Huskies and Johnnies are No. 2 seeds on our board to open the season, but we like the former to win the regular-season crown and the latter to cut down the nets at the Big East tournament. The major difference comes later in March, when Rick Pitino leads St. John's to the Elite Eight and UConn falls in the second round in its chase for Dan Hurley's third NCAA title.\n3. Can the Big Ten really end a quarter-century of NCAA tournament frustration?\nYes. But I don't think it will be preseason favorite Purdue that takes the conference's first national championship since 2000. I've pushed my chips to the center of the table on Michigan.\n4. Are there practical considerations already determining the 2026 NCAA bracket?\nMore than usual. Houston stepping back as host of the South regional means the Cougars can play in their home town in the Sweet 16 and Elite Eight. Count on this after an opening weekend assignment in Oklahoma City. Another Big 12 entry, BYU, seems fairly locked on a West region placement and even more certain to open NCAA play in Portland (a Thursday-Saturday site) because of the school's ban on Sunday competition.\nOn the other side of the country, UConn and St. John's figure to have easy bus rides (to Philadelphia) when the bracket is revealed. Villanova could also play in Philly, having only three regular-season games scheduled for Xfinity Mobile Arena, but would be happy to see its name anywhere after three straight NCAA misses.\nOther schools whose fans should be comfortable booking opening-round hotels: Florida (Tampa), Duke (Greenville, South Carolina), UCLA (San Diego) and Gonzaga (Portland). These and other travel tips are available for no extra charge for longtime Bracketology readers.\n5. Which power conference gets the most bids ...\nThe SEC should once again lead the way with the highest number of NCAA bids, although the Big Ten will be within striking distance. What the SEC will not do is match its record bid total (14) from last season. A dozen bids seems like a more realistic number this time around, as it took a perfect storm of metrics and mediocre teams in other multibid conferences for the SEC to hit the mother lode eight months ago.\n6. ... and which gets the fewest?\nOnce again, the ACC is listed for this dishonorable mention. The conference's multiyear decline should be a thing of the past, however, with a healthy number of potential bubble teams that could raise the league's bid number well above the half-dozen projected at this point, in a push toward double figures.\n7. What are the other multibid conferences?\nLast season, only the Mountain West (New Mexico, Utah State, San Diego State, Colorado State) and WCC (Gonzaga, Saint Mary's) snagged extra bids outside the Power 4-Big East cluster. The American and Atlantic 10 sunk to one-bid status mostly as a result of poor nonconference results. This season, the American's best hope is for a team other than Memphis to win its automatic bid. In the A-10, multiple teams -- VCU, Saint Louis, Dayton, Loyola Chicago and sleeper George Washington -- have put together rosters good enough to be in the at-large conversation.\n8. If ESPN put me in charge of programming, what would the \"College GameDay\" schedule look like?\nWith the caveat that this is not actually the \"College GameDay\" schedule.\nJan. 24: Houston at Texas Tech\nCould very well be the game of the year in the Big 12, and also double the population of Lubbock for the weekend.\nThis is a no-brainer in Year 2 of the post-John Calipari era at Kentucky. Remember, the Razorbacks pulled the upset at Rupp Arena a year ago.\nFeb. 7: Boise State at New Mexico\nLet's branch out a bit and go to The Pit in Albuquerque for the first time in forever.\nIf my hunch on the Wolverines is a good one, this would be a colossal showdown of old-school vs. new-school Big Ten.\nFeb. 21: Tennessee at Vanderbilt\nLet's turn the set 90 degrees at Memorial Gym and look at Rece & Co. sideways (might not be a bad thing ...). Also, there haven't been enough seasons in which the Vols and 'Dores have been this good at the same time.\nFeb. 28: Gonzaga at Saint Mary's\nThe end of the best and longest rivalry in the history of the West Coast Conference.\nMarch 7: North Carolina at Duke\nI have to make Cameron Indoor the season's final stop.", "summary": "(summarizer_error: 401 Client Error: Unauthorized for url: https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions)"}

Remember when the highlights were two decently sized trades including middle-round picks? Everyone say a big thank you to the Jets, as three first-round picks were dealt on deadline day! The Sauce Gardner trade is only the second in-season trade including multiple first-round selections in the past 30 years. What a thrill.\nIdentifying winners and losers on deadline day is always tough. The Jets will be made a winner or a loser for their efforts today not by my words, but by the picks they make over the next two or three years. Of course, we can grade the quality of their work now (spoiler, they are winners) -- but this isn't the real test. The real test is what comes next.\nAside from the fireworks over the Big Apple, I have winners and losers from the Saints' busy day, the Patriots' quiet one, the ever-active Ravens and the surprising Jakobi Meyers landing spot. Let's dive in.\nJump to:\nGardner | Hall | Meyers\nCowboys | Jets | Patriots\nRavens | Saints\nDeadline winner: CB Sauce Gardner\nThe Gardner trade is as stunning as it is impactful. Gardner was nowhere near the trade rumor mill until the moment the trade was announced, and with good reason: He signed a $120.4 million extension just last season.\nAt the time of the extension, it looked like the Jets were committed to Gardner for the long term. But as they've traded him fewer than five months later, the team-friendliness of the deal becomes apparent. Gardner's signing bonus, which hit the Jets' books in 2025 and now sits on their cap sheet as dead cap, was relatively small -- $13.75 million dollars. Because most of Gardner's guaranteed money lives in option bonuses further down the line, the Colts will be on the hook for much of his outstanding money.\nIt was shocking to see a recently extended player traded so fast. But the financials are far less damaging to the Jets than instinct would imply. The Colts still get a fairly good bargain, too. Gardner's contract will cost them an average of about $26 million in the five remaining years of his deal (2026-2030), though it's highly unlikely that contract structure sticks around long. If Gardner succeeds, the Colts will almost immediately amend the deal to guarantee him money; if he flounders, they have plenty of opportunities to release him.\nBut Gardner is only 25, and while he's a bit more volatile than the true top corners (Pat Surtain II, Derek Stingley Jr.), he remains one of the 10 best players in coverage. This season has been his worst as a pro so far. He's surrendering a completion percentage 11.1% over expectation, according to NFL Next Gen Stats data, and a passer rating of 118.8 when targeted. But he's still forcing tight windows (61.9% of his targets), and the bulk of his coverage over the past three seasons was high quality. Gardner can be picky as a tackler and draw penalties given his grabby style of coverage, but again, these are concerns that keep him from being the absolute best cornerback in football -- he's still a great player.\nGardner was reportedly blindsided by the deal and did not ask to get out of New York, but he now goes from the one-win Jets to the two-loss Colts -- as big a move up the NFL standings as a player could possibly take midseason. Gardner lands with Colts defensive coordinator Lou Anarumo, a highly creative coach who will play Gardner in more zone coverages, where he's at his best with his length, ball skills and instincts.\nGardner is a field-tipping player who can match up with opposing star receivers. Anarumo will base his defensive game plans around Gardner, who is the best CB that Anarumo has had in his long tenure as a defensive coordinator. The Colts still have a weakness at CB2 so long as Charvarius Ward is injured, and their linebackers leave a lot wanting in coverage. But if Gardner returns to his 2022 and 2023 form, he'll erase one side of the field and allow Anarumo to use his coverage resources in those weaker spots.\nThe big extension was a win for Gardner this summer. Now, he has the chance to chase it with a ring.\nDeadline loser: Dallas Cowboys\nI'm glad that Jerry Jones has recently become obsessed with solving Dallas' run defense. It's a worthy pursuit. This was not a good way to go about it, though.\nThe Cowboys sent a 2026 second-round pick and a 2027 first-round pick, along with defensive tackle Mazi Smith, to the Jets in return for Quinnen Williams. Williams is 27 years old and still a quality player, but it's worth being detailed here. Williams has one All-Pro nod in six seasons as a pro, as well as three consecutive Pro Bowl appearances. He's a great player who at his best has been an absolute game-wrecker. His 2023 season, in which he had a pressure rate of 16.3%, remains the most disruptive pass-rush season for a defensive tackle in the Next Gen Stats database (since 2016).\nBut like Gardner, Williams' play has tailed off in recent years. He had a pressure rate of 12.0% in 2024 (still quite good) and 8.0% so far this season (quite bad). His time to pressure is also falling -- 2.74 seconds in 2022 (his All-Pro season), 2.79 seconds the following year, then 3.02 and now 3.16.\nOf course, a new scheme might return Williams to his preferred play style of upfield penetration and subsequent dominance. But isn't the theory in Dallas to improve run defense? The Cowboys already had a penetration defensive tackle in Osa Odighizuwa, whom they just extended this offseason. Odighizuwa had a 14.2% pressure rate in 2023 and 11.1% in 2024 from defensive tackle alignments. Since 2023, Williams has a run stop rate of 10.9% and a stuff rate of 4.6%; Odighizuwa is at 7.9% and 3.0%, respectively.\nOf course, Williams is larger and a more reliable run defender than Odighizuwa -- and he's a better pass-rush player without question. But he's 27 and turning 28, and I'm not convinced he's one of the five best players at his position.\nWilliams will play his age-28 and age-29 seasons under contract for a total of $47.25 million; if he continues to play well, he could cash in again in Dallas. But even with the value on the contract considered, the price to acquire his contract feels unforgivably large.\nThe Jets have the right to the better of the Cowboys' two first-round picks in 2027, as Dallas has both its own selection and Green Bay's pick (from the Micah Parsons trade). This tiny detail has enormous ramifications. Should the Packers make an NFC run in 2026, while the Cowboys suffer a losing season, the Jets can move 15-20 picks in the first round just by retaining that optionality.\nConsider how much teams have traded to move spots in the first round in recent years. When the Saints moved from pick No. 16 to pick No. 11 to draft Chris Olave, they sent a third- and fourth-round picks to get it done. The Chiefs also included third- and fourth-round picks to move from No. 29 to No. 21 to draft Trent McDuffie. These are small distances in the first round, and they were worth multiple middle-round selections of value. Every single slot in the first round matters, and the Cowboys handed control of those slots to the Jets.\nThis is not a good trade in a vacuum, and it looks even worse when you remember the Cowboys traded Parsons away for two first-rounders. The only difference in trade return between the Parsons deal and the Williams deal was swapping a first for a second, and now the Cowboys are paying Williams with the money they would have used (in part) to pay Parsons.\nHere's a hypothetical. The Packers' two first-round picks end up both at No. 29 -- two losses in the NFC Championship Game. The Cowboys' second-rounder next year ends up as the 42nd pick, and their first-rounder in 2027 ends up No. 16 -- average. Different trade value charts will give you different sums, but these two packages are roughly equal. The Cowboys might have traded as much draft capital for Williams as they got for Parsons. That's bad business.\nOn the entertainment value scale, this was the best trade of the day. It might bear good returns on the football field; Williams is a highly disruptive and talented player. But on the trade value scales, this deal was heavily weighted to the Jets.\nMarcus Spears breaks down why he loves the Cowboys' trade for Quinnen Williams.\nDeadline winner: WR Jakobi Meyers\nMeyers really wanted to be traded -- he requested a move over the summer -- and he actually got traded. Excellent news!\nDeadline loser: WR Jakobi Meyers\nThe Raiders' passing offense was pretty unhealthy, but I'm not sure Meyers' new home in Jacksonville is that much better. Injuries to Travis Hunter (knee, injured reserve), Brian Thomas Jr. (ankle) and Dyami Brown (concussion) have created plenty of opportunity for Meyers in the short term, but it's hard to imagine he slots in above Thomas or Hunter in the pecking order once they return. And that's not even including Brenton Strange, the highly productive young tight end who is returning from his own injury (knee).\nMeyers turns 29 this week and has one year remaining on his deal. A productive back half of 2025, coupled with his excellent 2024, could generate a solid market for a three-year extension. Meyers' last deal was a three-year, $33 million dollar contract, and $11 million per year is Tutu Atwell money, or Darius Slayton money. Meyers has been remarkably more impactful than that, and he is oh-so-close to cashing in.\nBut will he get those numbers in Jacksonville, where the passing game has yet to truly blossom? There's some hope. Quarterback Trevor Lawrence has a 59.7% completion percentage on the season in large part because of drops. The 19 drops on Lawrence passes lead all quarterbacks, but Meyers has only four drops in the past three seasons (283 targets) combined. A sure-handed receiver should quickly earn Lawrence's favor. If Thomas is out for a few weeks on top of Hunter's absence, Meyers will have the time -- and volume -- necessary to earn and retain Lawrence's trust.\nIt's not the best landing spot; New England and Pittsburgh would have been better. But it's workable.\nAdam Schefter joins Pat McAfee to break down the Jaguars trading for Jakobi Meyers.\nDeadline loser: New Orleans Saints\nWhen the Saints traded Rashid Shaheed to the Seahawks for fourth- and fifth-round selections, they got a decent return. Shaheed is a 27-year-old receiver with one year left on his deal, and as one of the league's premier speed threats, he has significant value even as a WR2 or WR3. They probably could have gotten more -- Jakobi Meyers went for a fourth and a sixth just hours before, and he's two years older without the cardinal field-stretching trait -- but it's a fine return.\nIt is frustrating, however, to frame the Shaheed trade relative to the Devaughn Vele trade from August. The Saints acquired a 27-year-old receiver this year when they sent a fourth- and a future seventh-round pick to the Broncos for Vele. Sure, he has three cheap years left on his deal -- unlike Shaheed -- so the Saints were making a move for cap health. They need to save money, and Shaheed would have been decently expensive on the open market next offseason.\nBut Vele has barely contributed to the Saints' offensive efforts this season. He has five catches through eight games. His opportunity will increase with Shaheed gone, of course, but from the start of last season to today, Shaheed has 64 catches for 848 yards and five touchdowns. That's a 17-game pace of 72.5 catches for 961 yards. Shaheed isn't just a Marquise Goodwin or Marquez Valdes-Scantling. He's a bona fide WR2.\nThe Saints got worse at wide receiver over the past few months, and their loss in talent outweighs their gain in cap space and draft capital to my eyes. Getting anything back for Trevor Penning, whom they sent to the Chargers for a 2028 conditional seventh-round pick, is a bright spot. But it's tough to develop young quarterbacks without quality wide receiver play, and that's the risk New Orleans is running these days.\nDeadline winner: 2027 New York Jets\nWhat a day in New York. The Jets have shipped off two of their best young players in Gardner and Williams, and in return, they added three first-round picks, a second-round pick and two young players over the past four hours. This approach reveals an impressively long-term view on team reconstruction, and it offers the Jets plenty of chances to turn their roster over in a Lions-like rebuild.\nThink about how well Detroit nailed that 2023 draft with two first-round picks and two second-round picks: Jahmyr Gibbs, Jack Campbell, Sam LaPorta and Brian Branch. Well, the Jets have two firsts and two seconds next year, too. A loaded draft class can fundamentally change a franchise's future, and that's what New York is pursuing.\nThat ... or a QB trade package. It's too early to say anything definitive about the 2026 quarterback class, but if there's a player worth the first pick in it, the Jets are in the driver's seat to go get that player. Beyond the 2026 capital, the Jets have three first-round picks in 2027: their own, the Colts' slot and the better of Dallas' selections.\nIn isolation, the Jets won both of their individual trades. Two first-rounders in return for Gardner, who needs to recover his peak form (not a sure thing!) in order to be worth that capital, is a solid move. I know others think the Colts dramatically overpaid, but I'm closer to the middle. It's a good deal for the Jets, not a great one. But their side is the side I'd rather be on.\nThe Williams trade, as I detailed above, is a clear and enormous win for the Jets. Williams is older than Gardner and plays a more fungible position -- you can get quality DTs in the later rounds of the draft far more easily than you can get quality CBs -- yet the Jets still produced a second-round pick and a future first. For general manager Darren Mougey, this deal is the masterstroke that might launch a successful rebuild in New York.\nRebuilds don't have infinite leashes, of course, and Mougey and coach Aaron Glenn are about to suffer through even more embarrassing losses to end the 2025 season. If they're bad in 2026, miss on a couple of picks or draft the wrong quarterback, then none of the capital accumulation today will be worth a lick. But for right now, before the chips have fallen, the Jets have built as impressive a stockpile of draft capital as I can remember. That brings us to ...\nDeadline loser: 2025 New York Jets\nTo be clear, I understand what the Jets are doing and why they're doing it. But let's wrench our heads from the pillowy clouds of theoretical trades and future drafts and return to the hard reality of the present. The Jets lost two excellent young players today in Gardner and Williams -- two of the exact sort of players they hope to draft and develop over the next two classes. The only way to build such a hoard of draft capital is to trade legitimately excellent players, and that's what they did.\nIt feels rosy now, to gaze upon those three first-round selections in 2027 and consider what could become. But lest we forget about the Jets' 2022 draft class which featured the No. 4 pick (Gardner), the No. 10 pick (WR Garrett Wilson) and the No. 26 pick (Jermaine Johnson), here's our stark reminder: It is possible to absolutely crush a draft with three first-rounders and still fail to find team success. Then-Jets GM Joe Douglas got those picks right (and RB Breece Hall with the 36th pick!) and was still fired two years later, as both Zach Wilson and Aaron Rodgers failed to solve quarterbacking in New York.\nRich Eisen reacts to the Jets trading Sauce Gardner to the Colts for two first-round picks and Adonai Mitchell.\nPicks and plans are gambles. You should try to make smart ones -- and the Jets have. But we can say, concretely, that the Jets got remarkably worse on defense today. They lost young stars, All-Pro players still in their prime. We should not pull punches here. Some of the best players in football were shipped out of New York so that the new front office and new coaching staff could have a better chance -- not a guarantee, but a better chance -- of building a competitive roster. One that Gardner and Williams will never see.\nThe team is worse than it was 24 hours ago -- a lot worse. It's understandable and defensible that it happened, but trading good players away is always risky. And it always hurts.\nDeadline winner: Baltimore Ravens\nThe Ravens executed three trades before the deadline this year. They acquired edge rusher Dre'Mont Jones from the Titans on Monday, and while I like the theory of that trade, we haven't seen Jones take a snap in a Ravens uniform yet. We have seen Alohi Gilman, the safety the Ravens acquired with a fifth-rounder from the Chargers in exchange for Odafe Oweh and a seventh-rounder -- and he has made a big impact. The Ravens also sent Jaire Alexander and a seventh-round pick to the Eagles for a sixth.\nSince Week 6 -- when Gilman entered the starting lineup -- the Ravens are second in points allowed per game, seventh in EPA per play and ninth in success rate. Gilman has been solid. He forced a fumble and recovered another against the Dolphins last Thursday, but his greatest value has been in the unleashing of Kyle Hamilton.\nBefore the Gilman trade, Hamilton spent over 70% of his snaps playing safety, according to NFL Next Gen Stats positional data. That means he was off the line of scrimmage and in the middle of the field, playing in space. He was only in the box on 17.4% of his snaps. This was never the plan with Hamilton, as he's at his best using his length, explosiveness and instincts to destroy plays at the point of attack. But the Ravens lost safety Ar'Darius Washington in March to an offseason Achilles injury, and Hamilton had to backfill the position.\nAfter the Gilman trade, Hamilton is back where he belongs. He has lined up at a safety position only six times in three weeks (3.4% of his snaps). He has been in the box on 56.9% of his snaps and has spent another 36.2% at slot corner. The ultimate Swiss Army knife, Hamilton can be an outside linebacker-esque edge setter on first-and-10, a suffocating slot corner on second down and a devastating blitzer mugged up in the A-gap on third down -- all while Gilman and rookie safety Malaki Starks occupy the defensive backfield.\nBaltimore has been thin along the defensive line all season, and Jones will provide snaps on both the edge and in the interior. But even if that's the ceiling on the acquisition, and all he provides is depth, the Ravens are still deadline winners for the impact of the Gilman trade.\nDeadline loser: New England Patriots\nOf all the teams that stood pat at the deadline (notables such as Tampa Bay, Denver and Pittsburgh), the Patriots are the team that surprised and disappointed me the most. The Colts' decision to get aggressive acquiring a blue-chip player is defensible, but controversial. If the Patriots, who look like a legitimate AFC contender with an MVP contender quarterback playing on a rookie contract, took a similar leap, it would be universally cheered.\nThe Patriots have good depth along their offensive skill positions and are getting solid play out of fringe starters along the offensive line, but any and all plus starters should have been of interest to Mike Vrabel. I understand passing on Meyers, whose skill set is quite redundant with that of Stefon Diggs -- but Shaheed would have brought a speed element to the Patriots' offense currently absent.\nI'm sure more trade deadline dirt will get kicked up now that the hour has passed. Maybe the price to trade for Chris Olave was so exorbitant that the Patriots are forgiven for standing still. But a legitimate AFC playoff push is in the cards for this team, and if it runs out of gas between here and the Super Bowl, I'm confident it will be because it lacks the requisite offensive firepower around Drake Maye to hang with the big dogs of the conference.\nDeadline loser: RB Breece Hall\nA tough day for Hall, who watched two teammates escape New York, sent a tweet clearly implying he wanted out of New York as well and then sat by his phone as the deadline expired. Still a Jet -- at least for the rest of the season.\nIt's surprising the Jets didn't move Hall. Perhaps they're more enthusiastic about extending him than they seemed this offseason. He's having a strong season, after all. Hall is still only 24, so he should have another full contract's worth of good football ahead of him. As always, the franchise tag ($14.1 million) and transition tag ($11.4 million) figures are quite small at the running back position, so even if Hall makes a stink this offseason and tries to get out of New York to join a more competitive team, the Jets can retain team control over him for at least another year.\nHall would have been an exciting addition to many offenses, but most especially the Chiefs, who need better play from the running back position desperately. Instead, he'll grind away his 4 yards per carry in New York.\nDeadline loser: Me ... in bingo\nIn my column earlier today, I built myself a deadline bingo board based on the scuttlebutt of the hour. Grading only on trades that happened today, we were almost a winner -- I just needed a player-for-player swap (which is pretty rare). If the 49ers had traded for Trey Hendrickson, that would have cashed my board, as well.\nAlas. There's always next year.", "summary": "(summarizer_error: 401 Client Error: Unauthorized for url: https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions)"}

When a deal happens, we often hear the old adage that it will take years to know how well each team did. To that I say: Nonsense. General managers don't get the benefit of hindsight while they are making their decisions, so why should we when evaluating those decisions?\nThat's a long way of saying I'm a big fan of trade grades, which document our reaction at the moment a deal is made. When grading trades, I evaluate them for each team based on on-field impact, cap implications, draft compensation and effects within the context of a team's overall short-term and long-term outlook. I like to think about decisions on two axes:\nHow confident are we in knowing if this is a good or bad decision?\nHow big is the impact of this decision?\nThey'll both play a role in our grades, though a low-impact decision can still receive a strong or poor grade. Low-stakes, clear-cut wins or losses still matter. Let's dive in on 20 in-season deals that took place before the NFL trade deadline, which passed at 4 p.m. ET on Tuesday.\nJump to a deal:\nPenning | Tryon-Shoyinka | Williams/Smith\nShaheed | Gardner/Mitchell | Meyers | Wilson | Jones\nPhillips | Alexander | Dugger | White | McCreary\nCampbell/Newsome | Oweh/Gilman | Flacco\nSaints trade OT Penning to Chargers\nChargers get: OT Trevor Penning\nSaints get: 2027 sixth-round pick\nChargers' grade: C+\nSaints' grade: B+\nThe Chargers' offensive line situation looked great heading into training camp. Now, it's just bleak. Season-ending injuries struck Rashawn Slater in August and now Joe Alt too. The interior has struggled. Overall, the Chargers rank 29th in pass block win rate and 27th in run block win rate this season -- and that's with Alt playing great when he was on the field.\nSomehow, they are 6-3 and contenders, with a 76% chance to reach the playoffs and 4% shot to win the Super Bowl, according to ESPN's Football Power Index -- though those numbers don't truly reflect the Alt injury. Making an offensive line move made sense. The question is whether they made the right one.\nPenning has experience at both tackle and guard and I suppose he could play at either position with the Chargers, though tackle seems more likely given the injuries. He struggled mightily early in his career, with a 72.7% pass block win rate in 2023 that would have ranked last among tackles had he played enough to qualify. He improved in 2024 with an 85.1% pass block win rate over a full 17 games at right tackle that was merely below average.\nAfter the Saints drafted Taliese Fuaga in 2024 and Kelvin Banks Jr. in 2025, Penning moved to guard and has recorded a 93% pass block win rate (average for a guard) and a 67.5% run block win rate (below average). He will be a free agent after this year.\nGranted, finding an offensive lineman at the trade deadline is tricky, but if I were the Chargers I might have preferred one of the Commanders' potential options -- Brandon Coleman or Andrew Wylie.\nStill, I understand they needed to add someone considering how dire the situation is and where the Chargers are in the standings.\nBrowns trade edge rusher Tryon-Shoyinka to Bears\nBears get: Edge Joe Tryon-Shoyinka, 2026 seventh-round pick\nBrowns get: 2026 sixth-round pick\nBears' grade: B\nBrowns' grade: B\nThe Bears needed pass-rushing help even before Dayo Odeyingbo suffered a season-ending Achilles injury Sunday. They made a small move to increase their depth at the position on Tuesday, but one that hardly moves the needle in terms of their overall pass-rushing threat.\nTryon-Shoyinka was buried on the depth chart in Cleveland and has played only 31 snaps this season behind Myles Garrett, Isaiah McGuire and Alex Wright. He'll get more of a chance to play with the Bears, rotating with Austin Booker (who had a nice 2025 debut on Sunday) and Daniel Hardy.\nTryon-Shoyinka was the No. 32 pick in 2021 by the Buccaneers but never turned into what Tampa Bay hoped. He has an 11.3% career pass rush win rate (below average for an edge rusher) and 15 career sacks over 74 career games. Adding him, especially in the wake of the Odeyingbo injury, is a fine move, if unremarkable. I would probably have preferred Titans' edge Arden Key, who I presume was available, in this spot as a more impactful pass rusher.\nFor the Browns, this is a simple and logical choice. Tryon-Shoyinka was barely getting on the field for them and is a pending free agent that is not guaranteed to net a compensatory pick, so dealing him for any draft capital makes sense.\nJets trade DT Williams to Cowboys for DT Smith, picks\nCowboys get: DT Quinnen Williams\nJets get: DT Mazi Smith, 2026 second-round pick, 2027 first-round pick\nCowboys' grade: F\nJets' grade: A\nThere's no other way to put it: This is a horrific trade for the Cowboys.\nIt is completely unfathomable for a team like Dallas to be trading away major draft resources for a soon-to-be-28-year-old defensive tackle on a salary-heavy contract in a season when it has a 7% chance to make the playoffs, per ESPN's Football Power Index. And yet here we are.\nLet's break it down, starting with Williams himself. Don't let the negative rhetoric I'm using fool you -- Williams has been a great player! Williams finished in the top eight in pass rush win rate at defensive tackle every season from 2020 to 2024 and had at least 5.5 sacks in each of those years (with a high of 12 in 2022), too. He appears to have dropped off in the pass-rushing front so far this season, however, with a 9.9% pass rush win rate at defensive tackle (17th-best) and just one sack.\nBut even as his pass rush has fallen off, his run stop win rate of 46.6% ranks second in the NFL among interior defenders. He's still a very good defensive tackle, and the Cowboys' defense needs all the help it can get. Dallas ranks 29th in EPA allowed against the pass and 30th against the run. But any compliments end there, because none of that comes remotely close to justifying this move.\nThe Cowboys had to be the highest bidder to get Williams, who would have been really valuable for some teams in 2025. But that's not the case for Dallas, which is 3-5-1. So the value of some of the draft capital and paying half of the $16.75 million Williams was owed in salary and per game roster bonuses this year is lost by Dallas' position in the standings. I wrote earlier that I didn't mind the Cowboys trading a seventh-round pick for Logan Wilson in that situation, but a first- and a second-round pick is so, so far beyond that.\nThe value Dallas gains really is for 2026 and 2027, when Williams will only get older. But they aren't getting those years for free. Williams's contract was salary-heavy (as opposed to bonus-heavy) so, assuming the contract was untouched, the Cowboys are going to pay Williams $21.75 million in cash next year and $25.5 million in cash in 2027.\nThe Jets probably cannot believe their fortune right now. By the time they are contenders again, it's very possible Williams will be in decline. Now they can simultaneously save on Williams' salary and turn him into serious draft assets -- all at a time when it's better for them, considering their need at quarterback, to tank.\nAs part of this deal the Jets acquired Smith, a former first-round pick who failed to make an impact for the Cowboys. Smith was supposed to be a run stopper for Dallas, but it never came together. He was relegated to five games as a backup this season with a 29.3% run stop win rate that is below average. Smith's inclusion doesn't move the needle for this deal. If anything, it's a slight negative for the Jets given his guaranteed $2.6 million salary for next season.\nThere are still a few minutes before the trade deadline as I write this but at the moment the Jets are far and away the biggest winners of the day.\nAs for the Cowboys? If they felt regret over the Micah Parsons deal and thought this would ease the pain ... trust me, it's only making it worse.\nSaints trade WR Shaheed to Seahawks\nSeahawks get: WR Rashid Shaheed\nSaints get: 2026 fourth-round pick, 2026 fifth-round pick\nSeahawks' grade: A-\nSaints' grade: B+\nOne of the NFL's hottest passing teams just got better.\nThe Seahawks currently rank third in EPA per dropback (0.25) and first in success rate on dropbacks (53%). And now they are adding Shaheed in a move that makes sense both on the field and in terms of where the Seahawks are as a franchise.\nShaheed, 27, is averaging 1.8 yards per route run this season. But I think that sells him short because that number is down a bit from his career average entering this year (2.0) and he's been playing a role that includes running fewer vertical routes (34%) compared to last year (44%). Shaheed also has consistently posted above-average open scores in ESPN's receiver score metrics, including a 63 this season that ranks 28th among wide receivers.\nAs a complement to Jaxon Smith-Njigba, I expect Shaheed will run downfield more often and be a bigger threat in that role than rookie Tory Horton was. When Cooper Kupp returns, he and Shaheed will make for a nice pair of secondary threats behind one of the best receivers in the league in Smith-Njigba.\nThis is the time to strike for the Seahawks. FPI gives Seattle an 84% chance to make the playoffs and a 5% shot at winning the Super Bowl. This addition helps boost their chances without mortgaging their future the way the Colts did in the Sauce Gardner trade.\nShaheed is a pending free agent but given the leverage of the moment for the Seahawks and their need I think they ought to be plenty willing to pay the cost. Shaheed is young enough that if Seattle doesn't retain him he should sign a free agent contract that would yield Seattle a compensatory pick -- if the Seahawks don't nullify that pick with signings of their own. Because the Seahawks currently have $79 million in cap space next year, per OverTheCap, getting that compensatory pick is not guaranteed.\nThe Saints are not rolling in cap space the way the Seahawks are -- and thus would land a compensatory pick for Shaheed -- but they got more draft capital this way than they otherwise would have. Considering New Orleans' 1-8 record, this should have been an easy decision.\nJets trade CB Gardner to Colts for WR Mitchell, picks\nColts get: CB Sauce Gardner\nJets get: WR Adonai Mitchell, 2026 first-round pick, 2027 first-round pick\nColts' grade: D\nJets' grade: A\nWow. Only four months after inking Gardner to a lucrative extension, the Jets shipped him off to the Colts in a shocking move. And you know what? They were absolutely right to do so.\nThis was a home run for the Jets, considering the four-year, $120.4 million contract Gardner was on and the compensation they received -- two first-round picks and Mitchell, a second-round pick a year ago.\nLet's take this from the Colts' side first. They're getting a player in Gardner who, at his best, is an elite cornerback -- as was the case in his first two seasons in the league in 2022 and 2023. He was a first-team All-Pro in each of those seasons (in addition to being Defensive Rookie of the Year in 2022) and recorded 0.7 yards per coverage snap across those two years, much better than the 1.1 average for an outside cornerback, per NFL Next Gen Stats. That number crept up to 0.9 in 2024 (along with 10 penalties) and then 1.2 this season. If Gardner plays to his full potential, he and Charvarius Ward -- who was having an excellent season prior to suffering a concussion -- could make a ferocious duo when Ward returns.\nIt's understandable that Indianapolis figured that this was the time to strike. The Colts have had the best offense in football by EPA per play (0.18) this season and the eighth-best defense (minus-0.02). Daniel Jones dropped to seventh in QBR (70.6) after a bad game Sunday, but the Colts possibly have the best rushing attack in the league right now. FPI considers Indianapolis the second-best team in the NFL and gives it an 11% chance to win the Super Bowl. Not only is this their best chance in years, but it's probably the best chance they will have for the next few years.\nAdam Schefter joins Pat McAfee to break down how the Colts were able to trade for Sauce Gardner.\nAll of that keeps this deal from being an F for Indianapolis. There is a world where Gardner is the difference between a Super Bowl and not -- and that leverage is certainly worth something. But the cost was enormous. Two first-round picks for Gardner elevates him into a tier of non-QB trade compensation where I'm not sure he belongs, alongside players such as Micah Parsons, Laremy Tunsil, Khalil Mack and Jamal Adams (another Jets trade success).\nUnlike some of those other deals, Gardner's presumably won't include a new contract by the acquiring team, but make no mistake, the Colts will pay plenty. Gardner's extension included only a $13.75 million signing bonus. The other money is in salary and fully guaranteed option bonuses of $20 million and $10 million in 2026 and 2027. In other words: the Colts paid two first-round picks for the right to take on most of Gardner's extension if they do not alter the contract. They'll owe him $25.5 million, $24.7 million and $20.2 million in cash from 2026 to 2028, respectively.\nAnd as well as the Colts have played, we can't forget how tenuous this might be. They signed Jones to a bridge quarterback's salary in free agency, and he wasn't guaranteed to be their starter a few months ago. It's not unreasonable to still have questions about Jones' viability going forward. Also, he's not under contract beyond this season.\nWhile I mentioned the upside of the deal earlier, we can't overlook the downside: This trade hamstrings the Colts for years to come.\nNow for the Jets. It's all gone wrong in New York this season, but I doubt they entered this deadline season dreaming of compensation like this. Yes, they lose a cornerstone player. But this is a team that only cares about 2026 and beyond. The surplus value of two first-round picks is immense -- who is to say that 2027 pick won't be a high selection, either? -- and comes at the ideal team for a resetting a Jets team that needs a quarterback. And they were able to shed the majority of Gardner's contract due to its structure. The Jets proceeding with their rebuild with Gardner on the team was a perfectly fine approach, but this is better.\nI'm also a major fan of acquiring Mitchell. While he had fallen out of favor after dropping the football prior to crossing the goal line in Week 4, he still retains major promise. Last season, Mitchell tied for eighth among wide receivers in ESPN's open score with Tyreek Hill and Zay Flowers with an 82 (on a 0-99 scale). While that openness didn't convert in major production due to suboptimal catching from Mitchell, poor quarterback play and limited playing time, it's still an intriguing trait. Between open score, catch score and YAC score, the former is the most important in terms of predicting future success.\nConsidering the Jets' record, their very lacking receiver depth chart, Mitchell's age (23) and his potential, he is the ideal player for them to bet on.\nRaiders trade WR Meyers to Jaguars\nJaguars get: WR Jakobi Meyers\nRaiders get: 2026 fourth-round pick, 2026 sixth-round pick\nJaguars' grade: C+\nRaiders' grade: A-\nThe Jaguars opened the season believing they had an elite pair of young wide receivers in Brian Thomas Jr. and Travis Hunter. It's hasn't worked out that way.\nThomas has had a shocking drop-off from his exceptional rookie season -- so much so that he has been speculated as a potential trade candidate. Hunter hasn't lived up to his draft hype so far, though he was showing some positive signs prior to suffering a knee injury that landed him on IR. Thomas also suffered an ankle injury in Sunday's overtime win over the Raiders but has a chance to play this week.\nSo Jacksonville turned to the trade market for reinforcements.\nIn comes Meyers -- a long underrated receiver, though he is having a bit of a down year, too. Meyers has recorded 1.5 yards per route run (down from 1.9 last season) and, more alarmingly, 1.1 yards per route run vs. man coverage (1.8). His ESPN receiver scores are down a bit from 2021 to '23 and slightly from 2024. Geno Smith and the Raiders' offense could take the blame for a lot of that, but we can't know for sure. Last season we would have said similar things about the Browns' effect on Amari Cooper before he was traded to the Bills (where he continued to struggle to make an impact).\nAdam Schefter joins Pat McAfee to break down the Jaguars trading for Jakobi Meyers.\nMeyers has primarily aligned as a slot receiver with the Raiders this season (he played more outside last year). Hunter played in the slot 55% of the time prior to his injury, per NFL Next Gen Stats, so there's some overlap, though both receivers can play outside. By acquiring Meyers the Jaguars can keep Thomas outside, where he has had more success this season (though the opposite was true last year).\nBut are the Jaguars in position to be acquiring talent? I think the answer to that question is a slight yes. While they are only the 19th-best team in football, according to ESPN's Football Power Index, they have a 55% chance to make the playoffs because of their 5-3 record and due to having the ninth-easiest remaining schedule. Should the Jaguars have made this move? I'm not totally sold. The Jaguars have bet enough on their young receivers that I think they probably ought to ride it out. If Thomas can get back to form and Hunter can return to health and continue his ascent, Jacksonville's ceiling is raised. If not, they are probably in trouble either way.\nI can understand acquiring someone to bridge the gap until both are healthy, but a fourth- and a sixth-round pick is pretty pricey for a rental player -- Meyers is a free agent after this season -- who doesn't necessarily raise the ceiling that much over Parker Washington and Dyami Brown (who suffered a concussion last week).\nThe Jaguars will probably recoup a compensatory pick for Meyers given their low levels of cap room in 2026, but it will be less lucrative and is less certain than, for example, the Eagles with Jaelan Phillips because Meyers is older (he turns 29 on Sunday) and hasn't produced a ton thus far this season.\nThis is a nice deal for the Raiders. They are noncontenders with tons of cap space next year, so they were in no position to expect compensatory picks. So dealing Meyers for as much as possible was the obvious move. They did well to get the compensation they did.\nOne factor unknown as of this writing is whether the Jaguars are taking on the remainder of the prorated portion of Meyers' $10.5 million 2025 salary. The grades above reflect an assumption that they are.\nCowboys add LB Wilson to their defense\nCowboys get: LB Logan Wilson\nBengals get: 2026 seventh-round pick\nCowboys' grade: B-\nBengals' grade: B+\nThere is something a little amusing about the Cowboys, desperate for help on defense, turning to one of the only teams with a worse defense than their own and trading for a linebacker that team benched. Yet that's the situation. A day after Jerry Jones said he'd made a trade and less than 12 hours after the Cowboys were upset by the Cardinals on \"Monday Night Football,\" Dallas acquired Wilson from the Bengals in exchange for a seventh-round pick.\nWilson, 29, started 65 games for the Bengals since being drafted in 2020 and signed an extension prior to the 2023 season. He recorded a 32.5% run stop win rate in 2025, almost perfectly average among qualifying linebackers (he was average in the category in 2024, too). He has also allowed 0.8 yards per coverage snap this season, per NFL Next Gen Stats, a shade better than average for a linebacker.\nWhile it's certainly a red flag that Wilson was removed from his role as a starter in Week 8, and those numbers aren't anything exceptional, they hardly paint the picture of someone unplayable. And most critically in this case, Wilson does look like he could help the Cowboys. Wilson's run stop win rate is substantially better than Kenneth Murray Jr.'s rate, and his coverage numbers are substantially better than those of rookie Shemar James. The Cowboys are hoping to get DeMarvion Overshown back from injury soon, but in the meantime, linebacker was a weakness.\nBut at 3-5-1, should the Cowboys be acquiring players at all? In general, I actually don't have an issue with making a small move like this, despite them having a 7% chance to reach the playoffs, per ESPN's Football Power Index. If we were looking for a team that could have a second-half turnaround, Dallas would fit the profile -- a strong offense and weak defense. That's because defense is far more unstable, so a major improvement on that side of the ball is feasible, as unlikely as it seems now. FPI also still believes in the quality of Dallas to some degree, making the Cowboys the 15th-best team in the NFL going forward (partially due to the same reason).\nWilson would cost the Cowboys $6.55 million in cash in 2026 to remain with the team next season, so I think he will most likely be here just for the rest of the season (though it's not impossible he could stay if he plays well in Dallas). Wilson would be 30 next season. What I am surprised about is that Dallas had to pick up all of the remaining $2.7 million of Wilson's salary. The Bengals had benched Wilson, they are equally long shots to make the playoffs, and they almost certainly would have cut him at the end of the season. Given that, I would have guessed they'd be willing to eat some of the 2025 salary in order to earn a seventh-round pick. Turns out, Cincinnati didn't need to do that.\nNow, without Wilson, the Bengals will primarily rely on a pair of rookies -- Demetrius Knight Jr. and Barrett Carter -- at linebacker.\nTitans trade edge rusher Jones to Ravens\nRavens get: Edge rusher Dre'Mont Jones\nTitans get: Conditional 2026 fifth-round pick\nRavens' grade: B-\nTitans' grade: B+\nWhen the Ravens traded Odafe Oweh for Alohi Gilman I thought it was a fine move -- Oweh was losing out on snaps in Baltimore and Gilman helped upgrade another area of need for the defense. But there was no question that it left the Ravens' pass rush wanting -- especially with Nnamdi Madubuike out for the season. It left the Ravens with an edge rushing group consisting of Kyle Van Noy, rookie Mike Green, David Ojabo and the now-injured Tavius Robinson.\nSo in comes Jones.\nI was skeptical when the Titans signed Jones to a one-year, $8.5 million deal this offseason. He has been a bit better than expected in Tennessee, racking up 4.5 sacks, up from 4.0 last season. That's even more impressive considering how often the Titans are behind, which reduces pass-rush opportunities. His pass rush win rate at edge has ticked up from 10.5% last season to 11.6% this season. But that number is still below average for an edge rusher (he ranks 31st out of 49 edge rushers in pass rush win rate) and his pressure rate tells a similar story.\nJones has been playing as a full-time edge rusher, as he did last season. But earlier in his career, he moved around the line and aligned more often as a three-technique in some seasons. It's feasible Baltimore could use him inside some, especially without Madubuike.\nJones' $8.5 million deal included a $6 million signing bonus, so Baltimore is taking on at most the proration of the remaining $2.5 million. Jones, 28, is a pending free agent, so he could yield a compensatory pick for Baltimore if he signs a qualifying contract. The fifth-round draft pick compensation feels reasonable, though if the (currently unknown) conditions turn that pick into a fourth-rounder that might be a shade high.\nI thought the Ravens might aim a little higher. A reunion with Calais Campbell could have been an option (perhaps it still is) if the team wanted a better player a little more inside. Another choice would have been Jones' former teammate, Arden Key, whom I would prefer from a pure pass-rushing standpoint. Jets defensive tackle Quinnen Williams could have been a swing-for-the-fences option, albeit a risky one. Ultimately, Baltimore needed to make a move and Jones fills the need. I'm just not sure if he moves the needle.\nThis is a logical move for the Titans. They're going nowhere in 2025 and are currently sitting on $108.6 million in cap space in 2026, per OverTheCap.com, so it's unlikely that Tennessee will receive compensatory picks for departing free agents. They need to deal as many players on expiring contracts -- and then consider moves for others -- for as much draft capital as they can acquire.\nEagles land edge rusher Phillips from Dolphins\nEagles get: Edge Jaelan Phillips\nDolphins get: 2026 third-round pick\nEagles' grade: A\nDolphins' grade: C+\nEditor's note: These grades were changed due to updated financial information.\nIn the offseason, the Eagles looked like a team that could weather losing Josh Sweat to free agency and Brandon Graham to retirement. Half a season later, the vibe had shifted. A triceps injury landed Nolan Smith Jr. on injured reserve -- and he hadn't been particularly effective in the three games he did play. Za'Darius Smith surprisingly retired after five games. And Jalyx Hunt hasn't taken the step the Eagles hoped, with an 8.9% pass rush win rate at edge that ranks 41st out of 49 qualifiers at the position. Joshua Uche has been possibly better than expected as a fill-in, but he is just that -- a depth player who can flash now and again. Patrick Johnson and Azeez Ojulari (now also on IR) have been in the mix, too.\nEven though Smith could return from injury soon and Graham is coming out of retirement, the Eagles felt -- and with good reason -- that adding talent at edge rusher was a priority and made a move for Phillips, a good pass rusher in the final year of his contract. Injuries hampered Phillips' career with the Dolphins. He suffered season-ending injuries to his Achilles and ACL in 2023 and 2024, respectively. But when he has been on the field, Phillips has always been quite impressive. He recorded 8.5 sacks as a rookie and then followed that up with a 7.0-sack season in 2022 in which he boasted a 23.9% pass rush win rate at edge that ranked fifth at the position that season. He has a 17.1% pass rush win rate at edge for his career and is at 16.5% this season, both a shade above average.\nConsidering his track record and that he's getting back to form after his ACL injury, I think it's reasonable for the Eagles to expect him to be little better than that in the second half of the season. Phillips also generally scores well in run stop win rate, and that has particularly been the case this season, when his 30.5% RSWR at edge ranks 11th among edge rushers.\nThere's a pretty decent chance Phillips is a rental. He's playing on his $13.25 million fifth-year option, but prior to the trade Miami converted $5.1 million into a signing bonus, leaving the Eagles with just a $1.5 million bill to play.. While that means he might well be a stopgap solution for Philadelphia, it opens up the pretty strong possibility that Phillips could leave in free agency and net Philly a compensatory pick (perhaps a fourth-rounder, just like Sweat is projected to earn the Eagles, according to OverTheCap). The Eagles have $23.8 million in cap space next year (per OverTheCap), so while they could make some signings, they probably won't be huge players in free agency, thus making the comp pick quite likely.\nFramed in those terms -- a 2026 third-round pick for half a season of Phillips and a likely 2027 fourth-round pick -- this seems well worth it. The Eagles are true Super Bowl contenders, so the leverage on patching up any weakness is high. Anything that moves the needle on probability of a Lombardi Trophy is valuable.\nThe Dolphins are currently $11.9 million over the cap next year (though they would save a lot if they part ways with Tyreek Hill) and would also not be expected to be major free agency players next spring. But they absolutely did the right thing in dealing away Phillips. There's no guarantee he stays healthy the rest of the way nor any guarantee of how free agency will go (and therefore no guarantee of a compensatory pick). And the rest of 2025 is lost for Miami. The Dolphins needed to secure draft capital while they can, though I'm surprised they weren't able to also shed the rest of Phillips' 2025 salary and save a few million along the way.\nI would have expected the Dolphins to net just slightly more for Phillips given the prospect of the compensatory pick for any team acquiring him, though. Last year at this time, receiver Amari Cooper was traded to the Bills for a third-round pick along with a sixth- and seventh-round pick swap. Granted, Cooper's deal cost the Bills almost no money, but he also was not as good a player at the time as Phillips is now. Even so, if I had been the Dolphins and knew this was the best offer on the table, I would have taken it without hesitation.\nRavens trade CB Alexander to Eagles\nEagles get: CB Jaire Alexander, 2027 seventh-round pick\nRavens get: 2026 sixth-round pick\nEagles' grade: B-\nRavens' grade: B+\nEagles general manager Howie Roseman will not rest until he has turned over every rock looking for the best option at outside cornerback opposite Quinyon Mitchell. Earlier this week, he traded with the Jets for Michael Carter II -- a nickel whose presence might allow Cooper DeJean to play outside in nickel packages. Now, it's Alexander, the former Packers star turned healthy scratch with the Ravens.\nIn general, I respect throwing multiple darts at a problem, especially as a team with (repeat) Super Bowl champion aspirations. That being said, the chance that Alexander is the solution looks quite unlikely. He managed to play just 14 regular-season games across 2023 and 2024 with Green Bay, largely due to injuries. He signed a one-year, $4 million deal with the Ravens in June but has played just two games despite remaining healthy. Alexander's debut for the Ravens against the Bills in Week 1 did not go well. He allowed five receptions on five targets for 113 yards, per NFL Next Gen Stats. Alexander's 4.2 yards allowed per coverage snap were the second most by an outside corner with at least 25 coverage snaps that week -- behind only the Eagles' Adoree' Jackson.\nMarcus Spears breaks down why he loves the Cowboys' trade for Quinnen Williams.\nAlexander played just one more game with the Ravens the rest of the year -- when he had 13 coverage snaps against the Texans and allowed one reception for 14 yards -- and was a healthy scratch five times. Prior to this season, Alexander had a career average of 1.0 yards per coverage snap (better than league average) with several exceptional seasons in there. He has been a second-team All-Pro twice, the last of which occurred in 2022. The Eagles are hoping he still has something in the tank from that version of himself. Given his age and recent history, it's a long shot.\nBut I can understand the sentiment: The Eagles are trying to maximize their chances of finding a solution -- whether it's Alexander or Kelee Ringo or Jackson or rookie Mac McWilliams or DeJean or Jakorian Bennett outside with Carter in the slot. And if they think Alexander increases the probability of finding an answer by even a couple of percentage points, then it's worth it.\nFor the Ravens, this is a freebie. They're saving a little money (Alexander's contract was guaranteed) and gaining a little draft capital for a player who wasn't playing for them anyway.\nJets trade CB Carter to Eagles for WR Metchie\nEagles get: CB Michael Carter II, 2027 seventh-round pick\nJets get: WR John Metchie III, 2027 sixth-round pick\nEagles' grade: B\nJets' grade: B\nThe Eagles needed a third cornerback and hope they've found an upgrade in Carter. Philadelphia is in good shape at the other two corner spots with second-year players Quinyon Mitchell and Cooper DeJean. But with DeJean most effective in the slot, the outside corner spot opposite Mitchell has been an area of concern.\nAdoree' Jackson allowed 1.9 yards per coverage snap and a 27% target rate per NFL Next Gen Stats -- higher than any outside corner with at least 100 coverage snaps by a hefty margin. Kelee Ringo, who took over for Jackson in Week 4, had more success, with 1.2 yards per coverage snap -- just a shade over average. The team took a flier in trading for Jakorian Bennett earlier this year, but he has been on injured reserve over the past month (but has had his practice window to return opened).\nBut instead of trading for another outside corner, the Eagles dealt for Carter, a nickel, and are presumably bumping DeJean outside. Carter has been a solid slot corner for the Jets, the unheralded third player in support of Sauce Gardner and D.J. Reed. From 2021-2024, Carter allowed 1.1 yards per coverage snap, just a shade above average for a slot corner. His play was perhaps more impressive than the number suggested given he likely received extra targets due to the quality of Gardner and Reed. But that number ballooned to 2.3 yards allowed per coverage snap this season, albeit in a small sample, as Carter has missed three games with a concussion.\nCarter's contract runs through 2027, and he is due $10.25 million in cash in each of the next two years. He has $1.4 million fully guaranteed next year, per OverTheCap.com. At that price, the Eagles might not keep Carter long term -- it likely depends on how the rest of this season shakes out. But as far as this season is concerned, the Eagles are betting that Carter gets back to his former level of play while DeJean upgrades the other outside spot. That seems reasonable.\nAdam Schefter reports on the Eagles' trade with the Dolphins for Jaelan Phillips.\nMoving on from Carter was logical for the Jets. Jarvis Brownlee Jr., who filled in during Carter's absence, put up better numbers in a limited sample: 0.9 yards allowed per coverage snap when aligned in the slot. With the Jets long out of the running this season, it made sense to deal Carter, get off the hook for his light guarantee next year, and recoup whatever draft compensation they could.\nThat turned out to be a late-round pick swap, but the Jets also picked up Metchie. He is essentially a throw-in, but he also could feasibly start on a Jets team that has a barren wide receiver room. Behind Garrett Wilson -- who has missed the last two weeks with a hyperextended knee -- the Jets have Tyler Johnson, Arian Smith and Allen Lazard at wide receiver with Josh Reynolds on IR. The Eagles acquired Metchie from the Texans in an August trade, but he only played 14 snaps for them.\nMetchie was a second-round pick by Houston in 2022 but missed his rookie season after being diagnosed with leukemia. He returned to the field in 2023 but has failed to meet his draft expectations, recording just 1.1 yards per route run over his career. But the Jets might give him an avenue to significant playing time.\nPatriots trade S Dugger to Steelers\nSteelers get: S Kyle Dugger, 2026 seventh-round pick\nPatriots get: 2026 sixth-round pick\nSteelers' grade: B\nPatriots' grade: B\nSteelers safety DeShon Elliott suffered a leg injury in Sunday night's loss to the Packers that could cost him the rest of the season. Evidently, Pittsburgh felt it needed to look outside of the building for his replacement.\nChuck Clark took Elliott's snaps against Green Bay and was notably beaten by tight end Tucker Kraft on a 59-yard gain. Had Pittsburgh not made a move, it probably would have been Clark or another ex-Patriot, Jabrill Peppers, taking over Elliott's box safety role, with Juan Thornhill as the deep safety. Dugger, who fell out of favor in New England a year after signing a four-year, $58 million contract, can fill that void.\nDugger has 69 career starts and was particularly well-regarded during a 2022 season that included two pick-sixes. But he has played only 101 defensive snaps for the Patriots this season. He was due the pro-rated remainder of the $9.75 million salary he was owed, but the Patriots are picking up some of that, which makes sense and was probably necessary to get a deal done.\nBetween that, Pittsburgh's need and Dugger's past high-level play, I think it's worth it for the Steelers to make this move -- especially since it didn't cost them much draft capital. This is a secondary that has had a rough past two games (losses to the Bengals and Packers), so getting safety help can't hurt.\nThe Patriots had phased out Dugger from the lineup, as he really played only when Jaylinn Hawkins sat out time. Currently, we don't know exactly how much cap relief they are getting, but it seems as if they're getting at least some for a player that coach Mike Vrabel doesn't seem to want. That seems fine, particularly given the price of Dugger's contract in 2026 meant that he was certainly going to be cut if he remained in New England.\nPatriots trade edge rusher White to 49ers\n49ers get: Edge Keion White, 2026 seventh-round pick\nPatriots get: 2026 sixth-round pick\n49ers' grade: A-\nPatriots' grade: C-\nThe 49ers need pass-rushing help. Since Week 4, the first week after Nick Bosa's season-ending ACL injury, the 49ers rank 26th in pass rush win rate. They got some help from Bryce Huff, who looks as if he's back to the form he showed with the Jets, but Huff recently suffered a hamstring injury that is expected to keep him out this week.\nThe four players who have played at least 100 snaps along the 49ers' interior defensive line are Alfred Collins, Jordan Elliott, Kalia Davis and Mykel Williams. None of them have a double-digit win rate. Enter White, who I think could be quite a useful addition.\nWhite fell out of favor in the Patriots and was a healthy scratch last week. But he has inside-outside flexibility and his career numbers, particularly as an interior rusher, have been somewhat impressive on a per-snap basis. As an interior lineman, White has managed a 13.6% pass rush win rate and a 9.6% pressure rate, with most of those snaps coming the previous two seasons. Those numbers would be solidly above average for an interior player. White plays more frequently on the edge, but in an unusual quirk, his numbers are not as strong there.\nBart Scott joins \"Get Up\" to explain why the Ravens should be trying to make a defensive acquisition ahead of the NFL trade deadline.\nWhite probably will be a rotational player at best for the 49ers but considering their need, the cost (almost nothing) and that the 49ers will have White under contract for only $1.8 million in 2026, I think this is quite a nifty deadline deal for San Francisco.\nIt was clear White fell out of favor in New England. He was buried on a strong depth chart, with Harold Landry III and K'Lavon Chaisson having nice seasons on the edge and Milton Williams and Christian Barmore playing well inside. But considering that the 6-2 Patriots should be harboring deep playoff expectations, the compensation they received does not make up for the loss in depth. Should injuries strike, they might wish they had White back.\nTitans trade CB McCreary to Rams\nRams get: CB Roger McCreary, conditional 2026 sixth-round pick\nTitans get: Conditional 2026 fifth-round pick\nRams' grade: B+\nTitans' grade: B-\nThe Rams kicked off the penultimate week of the 2025 trading season by trading with the Titans for McCreary, who has mostly served as a slot corner. McCreary is known for his consistency: In each of the past four seasons, he has allowed between 1.0 and 1.2 yards per coverage snap, per NFL Next Gen Stats -- at or slightly worse than the league average for a slot corner (1.0) or outside corner (1.1).\nThe interesting aspect of this is that the Rams already had a nickel they were presumably happy with in Quentin Lake, whose 0.9 yards allowed per coverage snap is sixth best among slot corners with at least 100 coverage snaps.\nAs of this writing, I don't know exactly how the Rams will deploy McCreary. Will he play nickel, with Lake being bumped back to safety? Or could they put McCreary outside, replacing the snaps of either Emmanuel Forbes Jr. or Cobie Durant, who have been rotating along with Darious Williams (who has a very strong 0.6 yards allowed per coverage snap this season). McCreary certainly gives the Rams flexibility.\nMoving the fourth-year corner was an easy choice for the Titans. Not only is Tennessee well out of contention and McCreary in the last year of his rookie contract, but the Titans also have so much cap space next year (almost $113 million, per OverTheCap.com -- more than any other team) that they are likely to be spenders in free agency and therefore less likely to receive compensatory picks for lost free agents than most teams. Therefore, it's better for them to get whatever draft capital they can through trades for players who won't be around next season.\nThe draft pick compensation after the pick swap works out to roughly an early sixth-rounder, by our draft pick valuations. It strikes me as a shade lighter than I would have expected considering there are other teams likely to be in the cornerback market between now and next Tuesday. That's why it's worthwhile for the Rams to make a move like this -- secondary depth is good when you're trying to make a run! If I were Tennessee, I might have held out until next week to see if a better offer came in, but I wouldn't expect to get that much more.\nBrowns trade CB Newsome to Jaguars for CB Campbell\nBrowns get: CB Tyson Campbell, 2026 seventh-round pick (via Eagles)\nJaguars get: CB Greg Newsome II, 2026 sixth-round pick (via Jets)\nBrowns' grade: B\nJaguars' grade: B-\nWe've got ourselves a challenge trade of sorts.\nThe Browns and Jaguars -- two teams on opposite ends of the contention spectrum -- decided to flip-flop fifth-year cornerbacks. However, because of their very different contract situations, this isn't exactly a like-for-like swap.\nBut let's start with the players themselves.\nCampbell was off to a rocky start this season, allowing 1.6 yards per coverage snap (well above the 1.1 average for an outside corner). That he also allowed 1.6 yards per zone coverage snap was even worse, because corners tend to have lower yards allowed per snap in zone -- and the Jaguars play a lot of it. That 1.6 is a career worst for Campbell, who posted a solid 1.0 last season and had gotten as low as 0.6 in 2022. Like many corners, Campbell's career has been up and down.\nMeanwhile, Newsome entered the season as a trade candidate (I pitched a Newsome trade for almost nothing in July) given his guaranteed money and a down 2024 campaign in which he allowed 1.5 yards per coverage snap. That number has remained level in 2025, though his zone coverage numbers have been better than his man numbers during each of the past two seasons.\nBoth Newsome and Campbell have been flagged twice for penalties this season.\nThough Newsome had played outside corner in Cleveland, he provides slot flexibility. But Jourdan Lewis is playing well at nickel right now for Jacksonville, so I presume Newsome will remain outside.\nNow to the huge part of this deal: the difference in these two players' contracts.\nNewsome is in the final year of his, playing on a fifth-year option worth $13.4 million this season.\nOn the other hand, Campbell signed an extension during the 2024 offseason -- notably, with the Jaguars' previous front office regime -- that runs through 2028. Campbell's deal includes $13.1 million in fully guaranteed 2026 money and non-guaranteed $16 million and $16.5 million in cash in 2027 and 2028, respectively, per OverTheCap.com, with a rolling guarantee on some of that 2027 money. Campbell was due a $12.4 million option bonus in 2025; as of this writing, I am not certain whether the Jaguars already paid that out, but I will currently grade this deal as if they had.\nAssuming that's the case, the Browns are shedding money in the short term by exchanging Newsome's remaining guaranteed salary for a proration of Campbell's $2 million salary plus per-game roster bonuses. But then they will be on the hook for Campbell's $13.1 million next year and will trigger an $8.9 million guarantee of his 2027 money, per Roster Management System, if they keep him. I find this detail critical.\nBy my count -- I'll confess to some late-night, back-of-the-napkin contract arithmetic -- I think the Browns would pay around $5.5 million more for Campbell than Newsome if they cut Campbell after this year. That number grows to around $15 million if they keep Campbell for 2026 but cut him after that year or around $22.5 million if they keep him through 2027 (with a pure team option on 2028).\nIf that's right, then they're essentially betting that Campbell's short-term play this year won't carry forward. It could cost the Browns a few million if they're wrong. It could save them quite a few more million if they're right. I don't love committing more guaranteed money mid-rebuild with a tight medium-term cap situation, but I see where they can find value.\nThis only makes sense for the Jaguars if they believe Newsome is an immediate upgrade. But is he? I don't think that was the consensus opinion heading into the season, and I'm not sure the numbers suggest a change of heart. Still, cornerback evaluation is fraught with errors, so it's possible. And while they lose the long-term upside of Campbell's deal, this will give them more financial flexibility in the 2026 offseason.\nRavens trade Oweh to Chargers for Gilman\nChargers get: Edge Odafe Oweh, 2027 seventh-round pick (originally from Rams)\nRavens get: S Alohi Gilman, 2026 fifth-round pick\nChargers' grade: B\nRavens' grade: B\nWe've got ourselves an intra-Harbaugh, player-for-player swap. And it's an interesting cross-positional defensive deal.\nLet's start with the Chargers. Since (and perhaps even before) losing Khalil Mack to an elbow injury in Week 2, the Chargers looked like a team needing to add pass-rushing help. Without Mack for now, the Chargers were rolling with Bud Dupree and Tuli Tuipulotu at edge rusher. Both have been below average for the position so far in terms of pass rush win rate (Tuipulotu at 14.9% and Dupree at 11.7% -- average for this season is 16.3%).\nDespite zero sacks this season, Oweh is an improvement in this department. His pass rush win rate at edge is 20%, which would be a career high for him. Last season, Oweh recorded 10.0 sacks and a 16.5% pass rush win rate. He is playing on his fifth-year option, costing $13.25 million in salary this year. The Chargers will presumably pick up the prorated portion of his deal for this season.\nThe Chargers lose a starter in Gilman, but they have veterans Tony Jefferson and Elijah Molden still on the roster along with Derwin James Jr., though he mostly plays as a nickel. Gilman, like Oweh, is in the final year of his (much cheaper) contract.\nAlthough Oweh hit double-digit sacks for the Ravens in 2024, he played only 45% of the defensive snaps this season. Baltimore has historically been more willing to part with edge rushers than most teams, and it has replacements already in place. Rookie second-rounder Mike Green and Tavius Robinson were already playing a higher percentage of snaps than Oweh, and Kyle Van Noy returned from a hamstring injury last week. However, Robinson and Green are sporting just 7.7% and 5.5% pass rush win rates at edge, respectively. Van Noy is at 17% in a limited sample, but this is an edge rushing group that is hardly overwhelming.\nGilman gives the Ravens a third safety (they also added C.J. Gardner-Johnson to the practice squad on Tuesday). That helps in the short term if Kyle Hamilton misses more time, but safety should be an asset for Baltimore once Hamilton returns. The Ravens like to play three safeties: Last season, they played a combination of Hamilton, Ar'Darius Washington and either Marcus Williams or Eddie Jackson for 290 snaps. With Washington injured, they haven't had that type of three-safety flexibility this season. Perhaps they do now.\nWith both Oweh and Gilman impending free agents, compensatory picks are a factor worth considering. If the Chargers and/or Ravens don't re-sign the players, they could each net a compensatory pick in return. That's potentially more beneficial to the Chargers considering edge rushers get paid much more than safeties, though the Chargers have so much cap space next year they might be spenders in free agency (and thus not get any comp picks).\nUltimately, this is a rare player-for-player swap between two teams hoping to contend in 2025 (yes, the Ravens are still in that bucket) and opting to lightly subtract from one area of perhaps light surplus to fill a greater need. The Chargers added a player at a more impactful position but had to pay in both draft capital and cap space to do so. Baltimore is rolling the dice, losing Oweh to add some wrinkles to the back end of its defense while gaining some draft and cap flexibility while at it.\nI can see how this works from both sides.\nBrowns trade QB Flacco to Bengals\nBengals get: QB Joe Flacco, 2026 sixth-round pick\nBrowns get: 2026 fifth-round pick\nBrowns' grade: B+\nBengals' grade: C\nJake Browning forced the Bengals' hand. After his disastrous three-game stretch as the team's starter in the wake of Joe Burrow's turf toe injury, Cincinnati chose to trade for Flacco to get another QB option.\nThe Bengals are correct to try to find an alternative at this point. As high as I was on Browning -- I called him the second-best backup in the league just a few weeks ago -- his 35.3 QBR this season has significantly altered what we should think of him going forward, even if those three games came against the Vikings, Broncos and Lions.\nThe Bengals have no time to waste. Burrow could potentially be back for the end of the regular season and the playoffs, but Cincinnati must win enough games in order to put that scenario in play. At 2-3 they aren't out of it (especially in a wide-open AFC North), but the clock is ticking. ESPN's Football Power Index gave the Bengals only a 9.2% chance to make the playoffs with Browning at quarterback.\nSo the Bengals needed to make a move, and they did. But is this the right quarterback? That's where I take issue with the trade.\nFlacco is coming off a failed stint as the Browns' starter in which he recorded as disastrous 27.6 QBR, 4.6 yards per dropback and a 4.2% (!) turnover rate. And that came playing for Kevin Stefanski, with whom Flacco had some level of success with in 2023. At 40 years old, Flacco could simply be done at this point. And considering his play this season, are we sure he's an upgrade?\nIn my opinion, Cincinnati's first choice should have been Atlanta's Kirk Cousins. If you're asking someone to steward the team to a .500ish record until Burrow can return, Cousins can probably do that better than any quarterback who realistically could be available. I would have been willing to pay more for him, too, considering the leverage and importance here. But would the Falcons be willing to trade Cousins? For how much? And are they willing to trade him now -- this far ahead of the deadline? The last question is important, because the Bengals had urgency.\nBut even if Cousins wasn't available, there were other options -- namely, one of the Giants' backup quarterbacks. The Giants don't need Russell Wilson and Jameis Winston now that they've turned to Jaxson Dart. If I were Cincinnati, I would rather have either Wilson or Winston than Flacco. And I suspect the Giants would have taken this deal for one of them.\nThis is found money for the Browns -- even if it's heavy pocket change. Cleveland is in full rebuild/evaluate-quarterback-play-for-the-future mode, so Flacco's job as a bridge quarterback was done. They can play Dillon Gabriel and/or Shedeur Sanders the rest of the way. And there should be zero qualms about trading Flacco within the division. Whether the Bengals contend in 2025 doesn't affect the Browns when it matters (2026 and beyond). If anything, it's better to take draft capital from a rival than anyone else.\nTexans trade OT Robinson to Browns\nBrowns get: OT Cam Robinson, 2027 seventh-round pick\nTexans get: 2027 sixth-round pick\nBrowns' grade: A-\nTexans' grade: C\nThe Browns needed help at tackle and found an unlikely partner in the Texans -- another team with offensive line woes. Houston signed Robinson to a one-year, $12 million deal this offseason to shore up their left tackle position after trading away Laremy Tunsil.\nAt the time, I was a fan of the deal. Though Robinson has long been overrated with below average win rates, he had experience (7½ seasons with the Jaguars and Vikings) and looked better than a replacement level tackle. It turned out he could barely crack the starting lineup. After starting as Houston's left tackle in Week 1, the team shifted rookie Aireontae Ersery to the left side in Week 2 and kicked Tytus Howard out to right tackle.\nIt's a bad sign that Robinson couldn't start in Houston. The team ranks 28th in pass block win rate this season, though Ersery has been decent with an 89.0% pass block win rate (average for a tackle). That's well above Robinson's career 82.9% PBWR. Ersery is below average in run block win rate (72.6%), but that's also better than Robinson's career number (68.9%).\nThe Texans paid $8.75 million of Robinson's $12 million 2025 contract via a signing bonus, so the Browns are only on the hook for the proration of his $2 million base salary and $1.25 million in per-game roster bonuses, per ESPN's Jeremy Fowler. He also has $500,000 in incentives.\nStill, it's remarkable the Texans are cutting bait on a $12 million free agency signing just four games into the season, particularly because a large chunk of it was the signing bonus. A further $1.25 million was in per game roster bonuses, meaning Houston will have already paid close to a quarter of that sum.\nI'm all for ignoring sunk costs, but Robinson still offered some value as a backup at a key position of uncertainty. In exchange for losing him, the Texans only got a little cap relief and minimal draft pick compensation at a time when Houston hopes to contend. With Robinson gone, Blake Fisher is the team's clear No. 3 tackle.\nIt's easier to see why the Browns made this move. The team just lost left tackle Dawand Jones for the season to a knee injury. And outside of 16 snaps in Week 1, they have been without right tackle Jack Conklin due to an elbow injury. That has meant playing a combination of Cornelius Lucas and KT Leveston at each tackle spot. The duo rank 61st and 57th, respectively, in pass block win rate out of 66 qualifying tackles this season.\nIn Robinson, the Browns surely hope they have at least a slight upgrade at left tackle. And they didn't have to give up much in either draft pick or salary compensation to get him. While Cleveland is clearly not a contender this season, they can benefit from at least decent pass protection once they turn to one or both of their rookie quarterbacks. That makes a move like this worth it.\nTitans trade CB Brownlee to Jets\nJets get: CB Jarvis Brownlee Jr., 2026 seventh-round pick\nTitans get: 2026 sixth-round pick\nJets' grade: A-\nTitans' grade: C\nWith free agent signing Brandon Stephens struggling and limited depth behind him, the Jets waded back into the trade market for a young cornerback with experience.\nStephens, who was signed to a surprisingly expensive three-year, $36 million deal this offseason despite having a poor season in Baltimore in 2024, has allowed 1.5 yards per coverage snap thus far this season, per NFL Next Gen Stats, well above the 1.1 average for outside cornerbacks. So the Jets brought in Brownlee, a 2024 fifth-round pick who has already started 16 games and who brings decent numbers.\nBrownlee has allowed 1.0 yards per coverage snap in his young career, slightly better than average. His 15% target rate is roughly average, and his EPA allowed (+12.6) and completion percentage allowed over expectation (+2%) are positive, though those stats are unstable and unreliable indicators of future performance. Brownlee has also graded very favorably in run stopping, according to Pro Football Focus.\nThe second-year corner does get flagged quite a bit, as he has recorded a penalty on 1.1% of his defensive snaps since the beginning of last season, 17th most among defensive backs with at least 300 snaps. He has been penalized three times in two games this season. But it's not completely untenable, as his penalty rate lags behind old teammate L'Jarius Sneed (1.9%) and is slightly behind new teammate Sauce Gardner (1.2%).\nBrownlee has been a success story considering his draft position. With his experience and nearly three cheap years remaining on his rookie contract, I'm surprised the Jets got him for so little. At worst, he's a good depth option (my colleague Rich Cimini indicated Brownlee could provide depth at nickel, as well) with both short- and long-term upside -- especially if Stephens continues to struggle.\nI don't get why the Titans would want to deal Brownlee for so little right now. Rebuilding teams should acknowledge who they are and deal veterans for draft capital -- but that's not Brownlee! He is a young starting corner who netted very, very little in return.\nPerhaps the Titans got tired of Brownlee's penalties, or maybe there is another factor we aren't seeing. Brownlee missed the Titans' Week 3 game with an ankle injury, but that seems unlikely to be a major consideration.\nEither way, this move leaves the Titans with -- according to their new depth chart -- Darrell Baker Jr. as the starting outside cornerback opposite Sneed. Baker has made 15 starts in his career and his nearest defender numbers are solid: a 1.1 yards per coverage snap and a much lower career penalty rate (0.05%). But even if Tennessee felt good about Baker, Brownlee's youth and remaining cheap contract meant they let a lot walk out the door for almost nothing in exchange.\nJaguars trade RB Bigsby to Eagles\nEagles get: RB Tank Bigsby\nJaguars get: 2026 fifth-round pick, 2026 sixth-round pick\nEagles' grade: C-\nJaguars' grade: A\nEagles general manager Howie Roseman wins more trades than anyone, but he doesn't win 'em all.\nIn Bigsby, the Eagles acquire a very solid runner. The 2023 third-round pick accumulated an impressive 124 rush yards over expectation last season, per NFL Next Gen Stats, after a disappointing rookie campaign.\nBut that's all he is, which is his downside. Bigsby offers almost nothing in the receiving game; he has only eight career receptions. He has pass blocked on only 33 snaps in his pro career. And he evidently didn't win the starting job in Jacksonville this season despite not facing particularly stiff competition in Travis Etienne Jr. and fourth-round rookie Bhayshul Tuten.\nThis trade makes it clear that the Eagles felt they needed running back depth behind Saquon Barkley. They have Will Shipley, who figures to be more of a receiving complement and backup -- very different from Bigsby. But my first reaction was, wow, that's a lot for a backup at a nonpremium position who doesn't catch passes, especially considering how much Philadelphia has already invested at running back with Barkley. Even with Bigsby under control for another rookie contract year in 2026, this is a bit much for my liking.\nBigsby could also partner with Shipley on kick returns after having returned 11 kicks in his career. It's a more important role now than before given the precipitous drop in touchbacks, but it doesn't change that the Eagles gave up a lot for Bigsby.\nThis is a nice result for Jacksonville, though. It seemed likely that one of Etienne or Bigsby would be dealt after the addition of Tuten in this year's draft. That it happened now is an upset. But in exchange for their second- or third-string running back, the Jaguars are receiving a fifth- and sixth-round pick. That's great value, and it hardly leaves Jacksonville short-handed considering Bigsby didn't start.", "summary": "(summarizer_error: 401 Client Error: Unauthorized for url: https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions)"}

Barnwell on the Colts' risky all-in move and what comes next", "url": "https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/46847618/2025-nfl-trade-deadline-sauce-gardner-colts-jets-draft-super-bowl", "published": "2025-11-04T22:41:30+00:00", "cleaned_text": "Well, none of us can ever accuse the Colts and general manager Chris Ballard of being too patient or conservative again. With Indy stunningly sitting atop the AFC at 7-2 after Daniel Jones' incredible first half, the Colts made what has to be the most out-of-nowhere NFL trade deadline deal in recent memory Tuesday, sending two first-round picks and wideout Adonai Mitchell to the Jets for star cornerback Sauce Gardner.\nIt's a shocking move at first glance for both sides, though it might be a little more in-character after further review. Ballard has generally been a draft-and-develop GM during his time in Indianapolis outside of his moves to try filling the hole at quarterback. But he did send a first-round pick to the 49ers a few years for DeForest Buckner, who continues to impress on the interior of the defensive line for the Colts.\nThe Jets just signed Gardner to a four-year, $120.4 million extension in July, evoking memories of the Odell Beckham Jr. trade from their local rivals, when Giants general manager Dave Gettleman said he \"... didn't sign [Beckham] to trade him,\" then shipped the wideout to the Browns a month later. Gettleman signed Beckham to his deal, but he also inherited the star wideout from the prior Jerry Reese regime, which drafted him in the first round.\nThis Jets front office, led by coach Aaron Glenn and general manager Darren Mougey, inherited Gardner from now-deposed general manager Joe Douglas. They signed Gardner to an extension, but something about that deal should have hinted toward the possibility that the Jets were leaving the door open for a potential trade. And now, midway through his fourth season in the NFL, the two-time first-team All-Pro is leaving New York for Indianapolis.\nIt's certainly a fascinating trade. Does it make sense for both sides? Is there a clear winner now? Let's break it down, starting with what the Colts are getting.\nJump to:\nWhat does Gardner bring?\nDoes the deal make sense?\nWhat about the Jets' side?\nWhat are the Colts getting?\nIt feels like Gardner has already lived a handful of NFL lives since entering the league as a 22-year-old in 2022. The fourth-overall pick stepped right into the starting lineup for then-coach Robert Saleh and immediately transformed the Jets' defense, helping it jump from 32nd in points allowed per drive in 2021 to second in 2022 and fourth in 2023. Gardner had a credible case as the best cornerback in football during his debut season and was deservedly a first-team All-Pro in each of his first two campaigns.\nThat alone might be reason to treat Gardner as something resembling a unicorn. The list of players who were first-team All-Pros in each of their first two seasons in the Super Bowl era might as well be considered Hall of Fame spoilers. It consists of nine players. Running backs Earl Campbell, Eric Dickerson and Barry Sanders are in the Hall, as are legendary edge rusher Lawrence Taylor and return man Devin Hester. Active players Quenton Nelson and Micah Parsons are on a clear path to Canton. The only exception is former Eagles tight end Keith Jackson. Even if you want to give Nelson and Parsons incomplete grades, Gardner's part of a group where five of the six players who have completed their careers are Hall of Famers. That's good company.\nAt the same time, Gardner really hasn't been the same player over the past season and a half, especially after the Jets fired Saleh midseason. Per the FTN Football Almanac, Gardner was among the league's top cornerbacks as a rookie by just about every metric. He was still solid in 2023, but he fell off dramatically in his third pro season.\nWe don't have those same metrics for Gardner yet in 2025, but per charting data at Pro-football-reference.com, Gardner's passer rating against has risen for the third consecutive season, jumping from a 62.7 mark in 2022 to a 98.1 figure across seven games this year under Glenn.\nHis missed tackle rate, which was above league-average as a rookie, has been among the worst in the NFL over each of the three ensuing seasons, too. Then again, Deion Sanders wasn't exactly a great tackler, and that didn't stop the now-Colorado coach from winning Super Bowls and making it to the Hall of Fame. But that's a curious fit for a Colts team whose defense has improved, in part, by simply tackling better. Indy led the league with 157 missed tackles last season, 23 more than any other team. They're in the middle of the pack this season.\nAt the same time, it's fair to point out that the pass rush in front of Gardner has declined over that timeframe, too. The Jets were second in the NFL in sack rate between the start of 2022 and Saleh's firing midway through the 2024 season, and they are 29th since his departure. A massive decline in pass pressure is going to make it more difficult for any cornerback to hold up in coverage. The Colts are 16th in sack rate and 20th in pressure rate this year, but even that's a major upgrade from what Gardner was dealing with toward the end of his run in New York.\nOther metrics make it clear that he can still plaster to opposing receivers. NFL Next Gen Stats noted that 61.9% of Gardner's targets this season have come on tight-window throws, the highest rate for any regular cornerback in football. Some of that is likely a product of the Jets playing heavy doses of man coverage, which is going to create narrower windows and reduce space between defenders and receivers, but it's also an indicator that there's nothing physically wrong with Gardner leading to his decline over that past year-plus.\nFor Indy and defensive coordinator Lou Anarumo, Gardner's obviously a major upgrade on what they were rolling out at cornerback. The Colts have cycled through options at corner over the past few years with limited success. Kenny Moore II has been a reliable operator in the slot when healthy, but Stephon Gilmore was one-and-done before being traded, and second-round pick JuJu Brents played just 10 games amid injuries before getting cut at the end of camp. Xavien Howard was signed and retired before Halloween, while former Anarumo favorite Mike Hilton joined earlier this season and quickly hit injured reserve.\nIndy signed Charvarius Ward to fill one starting role this offseason, but he is on injured reserve after suffering a concussion. The Colts just got 2024 starter Jaylon Jones back from IR last week, but they've given significant snaps to the likes of Mekhi Blackmon, Johnathan Edwards, Chris Lammons and Cameron Mitchell at cornerback this season, all of whom profile as replacement-level options.\nAdam Schefter joins Pat McAfee to break down how the Colts were able to trade for Sauce Gardner.\nAnarumo's defense is at its best when he has maximum flexibility. Few defensive coaches in the league are better at tinkering, building weekly game plans and adding wrinkles to throw off opposing offenses and their preparation in real-time. The most famous of those moves, of course, was Anarumo shifting toward a three-man rush and drop-eight coverage around halftime against the Chiefs in the 2021 AFC Championship Game, flummoxing one of the league's best offenses in the process. Kansas City scored 21 points before halftime but just three after the break and through overtime, with Anarumo's defense stealing away the AFC title and coming within one stop of winning the Super Bowl.\nWhen Anarumo didn't have Jessie Bates III, a healthy Chidobe Awuzie and other veterans in the secondary, his defenses suffered. They weren't able to be quite as creative schematically, and when they tried, a young, underwhelming group of players made too many mental mistakes. Now, with the potential of lining Ward, Moore, Cam Bynum and Gardner in the secondary, Anarumo has veterans who can hold up in coverage and create big plays without many mental lapses.\nThat's going to give him all kinds of options up front. He has already unlocked some fun things, like using Buckner as a standup rusher over the center, as the Browns did with Myles Garrett last season and the Rams have with Jared Verse at times in 2025. The Colts are 22nd in blitz rate this year, but they've been the sixth-best defense in the league by opponent QBR when they do send extra rushers. Anarumo has tried to create sacks and potential interceptions with his sim pressure packages, but does the extra help at cornerback mean the Colts can just send the house more often and trust that the secondary has more hope of holding up behind?\nIf you're a Colts fan, you shouldn't have much trouble selling yourself on this trade. At the midway point of the season and fielding one of the most efficient offenses of the past two decades, the Colts have upgraded their biggest weakness with a 24-year-old player whose résumé strongly hints toward enshrinement in Canton one day. Even if Daniel Jones doesn't end up playing like an MVP for the rest of the year, Gardner should be both a major short-term upgrade and a long-term asset for the Colts, who have him under contract through 2030.\nWas it a good deal?\nGardner's the latest in a series of young star defenders to be traded for two first-round picks. As I covered earlier this year with the Parsons trade, those deals generally haven't delivered glowing results for the teams adding the superstars. The Rams won a Super Bowl with Jalen Ramsey, which has to count as a victory, but he was gone after one contract with the Rams. The Bears didn't win a playoff game with Khalil Mack, whose best game with the franchise was probably his first one. The Seahawks whiffed badly with the Jamal Adams trade, which led the Jets to land star receiver Garrett Wilson, among others.\nThere are differences between this move and most of those other ones. To start, the Colts also included a young receiver of some promise in Mitchell, who seemed to wear out his welcome with the organization after dropping the ball on the way to the end zone and taking a foolish holding penalty in the early-season loss to the Rams. Mitchell will make just $3.8 million over the next two-plus years, making him a relative bargain, and while his numbers haven't been impressive, he was able to get open in 2024 -- only for Anthony Richardson Sr. to struggle hitting the 23-year-old. If the Colts had shopped Mitchell on his own, they probably would have been able to land something in the range of the fourth-round pick the Cowboys sent to the Panthers for Jonathan Mingo at the deadline last season.\nThe Colts are sending two first-round picks out as part of this deal, and as teams like the Seahawks, Browns, Broncos and Texans can attest, there are no guarantees where those picks will land. It's tempting to assume those future picks will land in the bottom of the first round, but the Colts don't even have Jones under contract in 2027. I would be shocked if he wasn't back with Indy on the franchise tag or as part of a long-term deal next year, but Jones has a significant injury history, and he has never played at anything close to this level before. That 2027 pick could land anywhere in the first round, which has to be very appealing to the Jets.\nBy making this deal in the middle of the season, though, the Colts can feel way more confident that the 2026 selection isn't going to land in the top half of the first round. It's always possible that the Colts go on a massive losing streak or Jones suffers a season-ending injury next week, but ESPN's Football Power Index projects the 2026 first-rounder the Colts are sending to be the 26th pick. Sending a first-rounder in 2027 and a pick that's extremely likely to land at the bottom of the first-round in 2026 isn't quite as expensive as shipping off two future first-rounders with no idea of where even one of them might land.\nThe other key difference is the contractual situation. Those players I mentioned all received new contracts as part of those deals. Gardner has already received his contract, a four-year, $120.4 million pact. The Jets already paid a $13.8 million signing bonus as part of that deal, which is a lot to pay for eight games of a player they were going to trade, but they also hinted at being open to moving Gardner as part of the right deal. That's a very small signing bonus for a young player signing a significant second contract, though the Jets also only gave Garrett Wilson $13.8 million as the bonus on his deal.\nGardner's still in the fourth year of his rookie contract and had his fifth-year option picked up before the extension, so the Colts have six years of cost control. They're paying Gardner $131.5 million over the next six years, $60.2 million of which is non-guaranteed money between 2029 and 2030. Gardner will likely be looking for a new contract or be released from this existing deal by the start of the 2030 league year.\nIf you consider the value of those two rookie-contract years, the Colts are paying Gardner just under $22 million per season. In terms of the extension the Colts are absorbing as part of this deal, they're on the hook for a four-year, $106 million contract, which is $26.5 million per season. That would have been a slightly below-market deal if the Colts had traded for Gardner this offseason and made the move then as opposed to now, as Derek Stingley Jr. had already signed for $30 million per year on his new contract.\nTypically, with these trades for two first-round picks, the players are able to use their newfound leverage to sign record-setting contracts for their respective positions. Ramsey, Adams, Mack and Parsons all signed the largest contracts in league history at their spots in the lineup, moving the needle by millions of dollars in the process. Gardner's one of the highest-paid cornerbacks in football with this contract, but if the Colts did this deal before Gardner was signed to an extension, he would have had the leverage to ask for something like $35 million per year as part of the trade. With that deal already done, the Colts got better terms on Gardner's contract.\nMcAfee blown away by Jets-Colts Sauce Gardner trade Pat McAfee is stunned by the Colts sending two first-round picks for Sauce Gardner, but is excited by Indianapolis picking up the All-Pro cornerback.\nAt the same time, the Colts have to factor in the surplus value of trading two first-round picks to acquire Gardner. Fans are always hesitant to treat first-round picks as guarantees of anything, and they can obviously hit, but the rookie scale and four years of cost-controlled salaries make draft picks bargains, even if first-rounders might have only a 50-50 shot of turning into above-average starters. The value of what you land when they hit outweighs the losses you deal with when they come up short.\nIt's unclear where Indy's picks will land, but let's use FPI's projection of the 26th pick in 2026 and treat the 2027 selection as the 16th pick, since it could land anywhere. Using Ben Baldwin's non-quarterback draft chart, that's another $19.1 million per year in surplus value over the next four years. Two and a half years of Mitchell should take that north of $20 million per season.\nIn other words, with the value of the picks needed to acquire Gardner built into the mix, the Colts are really paying more than $46 million per year to Gardner as part of this deal. That's about what the Packers are paying Parsons (without the surplus value for his deal attached) and more than any other non-quarterback in football. The top of the cornerback market will go up in the years to come, but that surplus value is what makes these deals so difficult to land as successes. Anything short of perennial All-Pro production from a player like Gardner makes this a net negative.\nThe Colts might feel like this was their chance to land a generational talent who would never hit the open market, and I'm inclined to think that Gardner is a true superstar at cornerback, even if he hasn't been that player over the past year. At the midway point of the season, they're in position to claim the top seed in the AFC. Ballard has been criticized for being too passive in the past, failing to do more to build a team that has almost always been competitive without ever really challenging to make a deep playoff run. If there was ever a time to make that move, it's now.\nAt the same time, great cornerbacks like Gilmore and Darrelle Revis have hit free agency in their primes, too. As a cautionary tale, remember that the Jaguars were in position to land the top seed in the AFC in mid-November two years ago, and after Trevor Lawrence got hurt, they fell out of contention and missed the playoffs altogether. They then failed to show up the following year and finished with the fifth-worst record in the NFL. There's still a lot of football to go in 2025, and there are no guarantees that the Colts we've seen on offense will be the Colts we get moving forward.\nMore than anything, what this does is essentially tie the Colts to Jones, whose 2025 performance is completely out of line with what he has done so far as a pro. Their path toward adding a young QB or players around Jones in 2026 and 2027 are compromised by this trade, which takes away their most valuable draft assets. If the Colts get this version of Jones over the next few years, that's not a problem. If Jones gets hurt or falls back to Earth, of course, the Colts will be hamstrung in their ability to find a long-term replacement.\nThat's a risk Ballard is willing to take, and I wouldn't fault the Colts, given what they've been through at quarterback since Andrew Luck retired, but the 2023-24 Giants are the downside for what happens if Jones regresses. Those New York teams had first-round picks to build around Jones and still couldn't coax solid play out of the oft-injured quarterback. Jones has looked different this season, and by making this trade, the Colts are signaling that they believe this is the real version of the 2019 first-round pick. If it isn't, even All-Pro caliber play from Gardner probably won't be enough to make up the difference.\nWhat's next for the Jets in another rebuild?\nFor the Jets, the calculus is much simpler. They simply decided that they didn't have a core that was going to develop into a winner. Given that they've been the league's second-worst defense by points allowed per possession since Saleh was fired in 2024, you can understand why they didn't feel like there was much risk in moving on from previous cornerstone players like Gardner and Quinnen Williams, who was shipped off to the Cowboys for a 2026 second-round pick and a 2027 first-rounder.\nIt would be hard to argue that the Jets got anything short of premium prices as part of their moves. Gardner's an incredible talent, but he plays cornerback, a position the league typically doesn't value at this level, with Ramsey as the prior rare exception. Ramsey was a more complete player and had better recent tape at the time of his trade to the Rams than Gardner does at this moment. And landing first- and second-round picks for Williams, who turns 28 in a month, is a trade completely out of line with what teams have been paying for veteran defensive tackles over the past two decades. It's an almost comically desperate trade for Jerry Jones and the Cowboys, even if Williams is still a very good penetrating tackle.\nJets fans will obviously have to endure yet another rebuild and some short-term pain as part of this deal, but given that the glory days of the Gardner and Williams eras in New York failed to deliver a single winning season, I'm not sure there was enough in the cupboard to justify holding on and hoping that things were about to turn around. Now, the Jets have five first-round picks and three second-round picks over the next two drafts. That's a staggering amount of draft capital, both to add young talent and to move up and around if they want to target a specific quarterback.\nI do wonder, though, what the Gardner trade tells us about how Glenn really viewed his top CB. The Jets shifted their philosophy from a zone-heavy scheme in the Saleh days to a much more man-heavy approach under Glenn. In 2022, Gardner's best season, the Jets ran zone at the seventh-highest rate. They were more man-heavy in 2023 and 2024, but Glenn ran one of the league's highest man coverage rates during his time with Detroit, and the Jets have played man at the fourth-highest rate of any defense this season.\nDid Glenn think Gardner was miscast as a man-heavy corner and moved on at top value from a player who wasn't going to look as effective in his scheme? Given that the Jets spent heavily on Brandon Stephens this year and landed a player who is allowing a 116.6 passer rating in coverage this season, are they reliably evaluating who and where they should be investing at corner?\nWe'll see how Gardner does with the Colts, but this is obviously a massive retooling at the deadline for the Jets. I think they'll look back and feel like they got a pretty good deal for what they sent out, especially with the Williams trade. But so much depends on what happens next. It's tough to trade away a 24-year-old with two first-team All-Pro appearances and feel confident that you'll land a similarly-talented player in the draft. But if Mougey uses these picks to successfully find the QB the organization has been hoping to land for decades, I suspect Jets fans will happily wish Gardner success in Indianapolis.", "summary": "(summarizer_error: 401 Client Error: Unauthorized for url: https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions)"}

What's N.Y. thinking?", "url": "https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/46847768/nfl-colts-jets-sauce-gardner-draft-picks-trade-deadline", "published": "2025-11-04T22:41:30+00:00", "cleaned_text": "The last time the Indianapolis Colts were considered this strong of a Super Bowl contender was 2014, when they entered Week 10 with 10-1 odds to win the title. They made it to the AFC Championship Game that year.\nThe Colts started Tuesday with 12-1 odds to win the Super Bowl, and that improved to 11-1 after acquiring Sauce Gardner from the New York Jets for two first-round draft picks.\nThe Colts (7-2) obviously believe they have their strongest chance to win their first Lombardi Trophy since the 2006 season as they went all-in for the 25-year-old Gardner, whom the Jets made the highest-paid cornerback in the offseason.\nIndianapolis travels to Berlin, Germany, this weekend to face the Atlanta Falcons (9:30 a.m. ET, NFL Network), but it's uncertain if Gardner will be ready in time to play. The Colts are hopeful.\nMoving the 2022 fourth overall draft pick wasn't the only major deal the Jets made before Tuesday's 4 p.m. ET deadline. They also dealt defensive tackle Quinnen Williams to the Dallas Cowboys for a second-round pick in 2026, a first-rounder in 2027 and defensive tackle Mazi Smith.\nThe Jets are firmly in rebuild mode and have accumulated several high draft picks. But how quickly can they turn things around?\nColts reporter Stephen Holder, Jets reporter Rich Cimini, NFL draft analyst Matt Miller and NFL analysts Matt Bowen and Aaron Schatz break down the trade from various perspectives. And Cowboys reporter Todd Archer weighs in on whether the trade puts the Micah Parsons-to-Green Bay deal in a new perspective.\nDo the Colts view this as the last piece of a Super Bowl puzzle?\nHolder: Possibly. It's the most formidable roster they've had under GM Chris Ballard, who has presided over just one playoff victory in nine seasons.\nHe hasn't made many big swings like this, and when he has, the results have been mixed. The Colts traded a first-round choice for defensive tackle DeForest Buckner in 2020, and that move netted them one of the team's best players of the past five years. But Ballard's move to acquire quarterback Carson Wentz with first-round and third-round choices in 2021 did not pan out well.\nThat Ballard is making, perhaps, the boldest move of his career should say quite a lot about the Colts' current position and their postseason hopes.\nWhat does this trade mean for the Jets?\nCimini: They're out of the Sauce business, but they have plenty of juice for the 2026 and 2027 offseasons -- five first-round picks, including a 2027 first-rounder from the Williams trade. It gives them plenty of draft capital to maneuver for a quarterback, their biggest need.\nAfter a 1-7 start, the Jets' new regime -- coach Aaron Glenn and GM Darren Mougey -- recognized the roster is more deficient than initially anticipated. This will allow them to fill multiple holes. The team got an early start, as former Colts wide receiver Adonai Mitchell was included in the trade. He's an underperforming receiver with upside, under contract through 2027. He joins John Metchie III, acquired last week, in a revamped receiving corps.\nBasically, the Jets are focused on the future. That's the downside to the trade: How can the current players stay motivated knowing the front office already is thinking ahead to 2026?\nIf the Jets don't trade up, what non-QB picks should they target with their five first-round picks over the next two years?\nMiller: Quarterback is clearly the Jets' biggest need but if we're talking non-QBs, New York needs to rebuild a defense that's now without its two best players. In the 2026 class, defensive tackle Peter Woods (Clemson) fits what the team needs up front. Should the Jets want to focus on the edge, Rueben Bain Jr. (Miami) is playing like a top-five prospect with a three-down skill set that perfectly fits Aaron Glenn's defense. Offensively, this is still a team in need of skill-position talent to ease the burden on wide receiver Garrett Wilson. Could we see the Jets pair him with a deep threat like Jordyn Tyson (Arizona State)?\nLooking ahead to 2027 -- a draft class that looks to be one of the strongest in a long time -- the Jets will have three first-round picks to use on elite prospects such as receivers Jeremiah Smith (Ohio State) and Ryan Williams (Alabama), along with edge rusher Colin Simmons (Texas).\nWhy did the Jets trade Gardner only five months after making him the highest-paid cornerback?\nCimini: They weren't actively shopping Gardner, but the offer was too good to refuse, especially for a rebuilding team. When they signed the $120 million extension in June, he was trumpeted as a foundational player. Life changes quickly in the NFL. Perhaps the luster wore off. By most metrics, Gardner is having a good season, but he hasn't played at an elite level since his historic rookie season in 2021. He has no interceptions; in fact, he has only three in 55 career games and his penalty rate has increased.\nClearly, the Jets saw a replaceable player. They're high on rookie Azareye'h Thomas, who replaced Gardner (concussion) in the last game and played well.\nRich Eisen reacts to the Jets trading Sauce Gardner to the Colts for two first-round picks and Adonai Mitchell.\nDoes this trade affect how we should view the Cowboys' Micah Parsons trade return (two Packers first-round picks and Kenny Clark)?\nArcher: Are we trying to say Jerry Jones made out better than expected now? I can't go there because the timing of those trades. The Colts were up against the trade deadline. The Cowboys carried out the Parsons' negotiations well into the summer when they had a feeling before the draft that a long-term deal was not likely.\nA move in the spring would have allowed the Cowboys a better chance to fill gaps on their defense. Indianapolis made a win-now trade for a young cornerback with benefit of their 7-2 start to the season. The Cowboys made their trade hoping on too many parts that have not come together so far. The true value of the Parsons trade will be based on what the Cowboys get with the two first-rounders, either with players or more picks.\nHow does Gardner fit the Colts' defensive system under Lou Anarumo?\nBowen: Gardner has the coverage traits to make the easy switch to Anarumo's scheme. The Colts play a ton of man coverage, which caters to Gardner's press skills. He's a rangy defender with the length to challenge receivers at the snap. And Anarumo can now use Gardner in specific matchups, especially on third down, where the Colts have played man on 62.2% of opponent dropbacks, the eighth most in the league.\nLet's not forget that Gardner can patrol the flat in Indy's Cover 2 looks, too. He also has the lower-body quickness to play off the ball in three-deep coverage. And we could see Anarumo using Gardner to lock the back side of zone coverages. While Gardner has been more of a ball disruptor than playmaker during his time in the NFL, his presence in the Colts' secondary definitely gives Anarumo more flexibility as a defensive playcaller.\nWhat do the metrics say about Gardner's level of play?\nSchatz: Gardner was stellar in his first couple of seasons for the Jets. He's back to being excellent this year, as long as you adjust for who he has been covering. However, cornerbacks are notoriously inconsistent in every possible metric, and Gardner is no exception with mediocre play in 2024.\nGardner finished eighth among qualifying cornerbacks in my cornerback coverage DVOA metric in both his rookie year of 2022 and his second season, 2023. Last year, however, he dropped to 64th. He allowed 9.6 yards per play in coverage, one of the worst figures in the league; his coverage DVOA was better because he wasn't targeted frequently compared to other starting cornerbacks.\nThis year, Gardner is back to eighth among qualifying cornerbacks. What's important here are opponent adjustments. Before adjustments, Gardner would have an average coverage DVOA. However, Gardner has covered opposing WR1 on 64% of his coverage snaps, tied for first in the league with Patrick Surtain II. That has included a lot of DK Metcalf, George Pickens (with CeeDee Lamb hurt) and Mike Evans. So once we adjust for opponent strength, Gardner comes out as one of the top cornerbacks in coverage once again.\nGardner was just signed to a record four-year, $120.4 million contract extension. What are the cap implications to the Jets and Colts?\nHolder: This deal will be relatively manageable for the Colts in the short term. Because Gardner's signing bonus was paid by the Jets, and because many of the guarantees are tied to option bonuses, the salary-cap implications are minimal for a contract of this size.\nThe Colts will pay roughly half of Gardner's $1.25 million base salary in 2025. They'll pay him in excess of $25 million in 2026, but the cap figure is a meager $9.5 million because option bonuses may be prorated over the life of a contract.\nGardner does have a sizable $13.5 million base salary in 2027 which, when combined with various bonuses, will push his cap figure to $20.9 million. In 2028, 2029 and 2030, Gardner is scheduled to have cap numbers of $26.2 million, $36.1 million and $36.1 million. Those numbers can be reduced or eliminated through restructures or via releasing Gardner.", "summary": "(summarizer_error: 401 Client Error: Unauthorized for url: https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions)"}

It was Oct. 2, a humid, 87-degree afternoon in Bradenton, Florida, where the Cavs were hosting camp at IMG Academy, a multisport facility that coach Kenny Atkinson compared to an Olympic village.\nAtkinson aimed to create a training camp that focused on more than basketball, breaking up the monotony that can form during a long season and giving the Cavs a chance to form bonds they will rely on throughout the season.\nAnd so it was that he took the team onto the track in the afternoon for a cardio-focused workout. It was right near the baseball field.\nJaylon Tyson, the second-year guard who has been thrust into the starting lineup due to injuries, challenged the team's star, Donovan Mitchell, to meet him on the diamond, guaranteeing he could get a hit off him.\nThe entire team joined them.\nMitchell took the mound. His father, Donovan Sr., played baseball in the minors and has worked with the Mets for the past two decades, and he passed down a love for the game to his son. Mitchell played baseball through high school and insists he could have played professionally.\nTyson, after a few whiffs, finally made contact, a foul tip, but it quickly turned into a full team batting practice.\nWith his baseball background, Mitchell was the only player the team trusted to pitch. When it was Mitchell's turn to hit, and some members of IMG Academy available to toss, the Cavs star cranked a pair of home runs -- the Cavs' version of Shohei Ohtani, at least among a bunch of hoopers.\n\"Just showing off a little bit,\" Mitchell told ESPN. \"Showing what I could do.\"\nMitchell is in his fourth season of showing what he can do for the Cavs. It's also Year 4 for the vaunted core of Mitchell, Evan Mobley, Jarrett Allen and Darius Garland, a quartet that has transformed the Cavs into contenders again in the Eastern Conference.\nBut Mitchell has still never played in the conference finals as the Cavs have fallen short in the playoffs the past two seasons, losing in the semifinals.\nIn 2024, they fell in five games to the Boston Celtics, who went on to win the NBA championship. The Cavs fired their coach, J.B. Bickerstaff, that summer and hired Atkinson.\nIn Atkinson's first season, a 64-win blitz through the regular season and a sweep of the Miami Heat in the first round of the playoffs had Cleveland thinking about a return to the Finals. But then the Cavs were dispatched, again in Round 2, a five-game trouncing by the Indiana Pacers as the Cavs' lineup was hampered by injuries to Garland, Mobley and De'Andre Hunter.\nThis was a different type of monotony -- not something a scheduling tweak could solve.\nHUNTER REPLAYED THAT series in his mind all summer, watching hours of tape to identify issues to address, holes to fill. He skipped film of the win but zeroed in on the losses.\nHe came to a revealing, but perhaps unsatisfying, conclusion.\n\"It was more mental than anything,\" Hunter told ESPN. \"Game 1, that's the game we're supposed to win. We win that game and the series is completely different. We just kind of were mentally weak, at times, and they were mentally stronger.\"\nThe Pacers had jumped out to an early 11-point lead on Cleveland's home floor in Game 1, then closed the fourth quarter on a 20-10 run for the win.\n\"I don't think it was anything physical. I don't think it was any skill gap,\" Hunter continued. \"I literally just think it was all mental.\"\nOnce again, Cleveland began the season as the favorite, per ESPN BET, to win the Eastern Conference and had third-best odds to bring home the Larry O'Brien trophy -- higher expectations than any year since LeBron James' last season with the team in 2017-18.\nSo Cleveland is doubling down on last season's edict -- that third-year big man Evan Mobley needs to be the center of its operation.\nThe Cavs achieved their most successful regular season in a decade last season by relying less on Mitchell and more on Mobley. And perhaps for good reason.\nDuring the past two postseasons, Mitchell has put up 11 30-point games; the Cavs are just 5-6 in those games.\nFor the team to get to the conference finals, the Cavs recognize they need to rely less on Mitchell as their Ohtani-like everyman; create a more dynamic and diverse offense, with new role players Hunter and Lonzo Ball adding to an already solid ecosystem; and give Mobley even more responsibility.\nThe Cavs are 4-3 so far -- a comparatively inauspicious start; they didn't lose their third game last season until Nov. 29. Their defense remains in the top 10, but their offense ranks 26th in the league.\n\"Those small tests can help us for the playoffs,\" Hunter said. \"We got a long season, and there's a lot of tests within that journey. We endure those tests, that'll get us ready. And, honestly, losing like that in the playoffs, whether it's a whole year later or not, it prepares you for that next time you face that adversity.\"\nMitchell also sees progress in the early regression. After racing through last regular season, he said, their task this season will be to ensure they are in a better position to succeed in the playoffs.\n\"Habits, man. You don't just figure it out,\" Mitchell said. \"We still got to build. That's what this whole regular season is about. You can't look at it and say just wait until April, because all the stuff that you do in April, the foundation is laid out throughout the season.\"\nMITCHELL GOT WORD in mid-August that the Cavs would be down two starters to begin the season.\nGarland's toe surgery, after the end of the playoffs in June, was going to sideline him for the start of the season, and then Mitchell learned Max Strus needed to repair a fracture in his left foot.\nMitchell had taken his own break from basketball after the second disappointing playoff loss. He got engaged to R&B singer Coco Jones in July. He dove deeper into his Mets fandom, joining New York shortstop Francisco Lindor for an hour sit-down on his podcast. The playoff loss stung, and he wanted to clear his mind.\nBut then the news hit that in addition to being down two starters, the Cavs' leading bench scorer, Ty Jerome, signed with the Memphis Grizzlies in free agency. Mitchell's real offseason began.\n\"Understanding that hey, this happened and we f---ed up,\" Mitchell told ESPN. \"Now it's like, 'OK, how do we not f--- up the next time?\"\nHe soon connected with Mobley.\nInjuries played a role in the consecutive playoff exits. Mitchell himself missed the final two games of the 2024 conference semifinals against Boston. In the series against the Pacers in 2025, Garland missed the first two games; Mobley and Hunter missed Game 2; and Mitchell was hindered by an ankle injury by the end of the series.\nMitchell is coming off a season in which he posted a 30.9% usage rate, his lowest since his rookie season in 2017-18. But during the playoffs, in part because of the injuries around him, it skyrocketed to 37.2%, the highest of any player in the playoffs and one of the highest in his career.\n\"Me and [Mobley] had a conversation, it was like, 'Hey, last year he took a step,'\" Mitchell said. \"That's his first year really having the ball like that. Now it's like, 'Hey, I'm not open ... it's you. That offense creation is coming from you. That's what we expect out of you.' But with that comes great responsibility, too.\"\nMobley, 24, averaged career highs in points, field goal attempts, 3-pointers, and free throws last season, in addition to winning Defensive Player of the Year. It earned him an appearance in the All-Star Game and his first All-NBA nod, but the Cavs still think they are only tapping the surface with his potential.\n\"He's handling the ball even more,\" Atkinson said. \"He's got to be a playmaker for us, and you're going to see an increase in usage again. But I want that balance -- between perimeter and getting him the ball inside and getting him the paint.\"\nMobley's usage rate is up to 24.7% so far this season, a marked increase from the 23.2% he posted in the 2024-25 season. And he has taken on even more of the playmaking responsibilities. He's averaging a career-best 4.4 assists per game.\n\"I just got to keep taking that on,\" Mobley told ESPN, \"Taking the challenges.\"\nThose challenges remain in question. After shooting 49.1% last season, the second-best mark in the league (behind Denver's 50.6%), the Cavs have started this season shooting 44.5%, 24th in the NBA. They're making the same number of 3s, but they're needing four more shot attempts per game to get there.\nAnd Mitchell has scored 33.7% of the Cavs' points this season, the highest in his four-year tenure in Cleveland, and he's creating many of his own shots off the dribble. According to ESPN Research, 81% of his made 2-pointers have been unassisted, and he's getting more points than ever from midrange, 13.6% of his points compared to 9.9% last season.\n\"I don't have the exact answer for you right now,\" Mitchell said before the season. \"That's going to have to be a feeling. A lot of that, too, is where [Evan's] at or where Dre's at and just being ready for whatever comes.\n\"It's easy to say, 'Oh, you kind of revert back -- but sometimes the situation calls for it. People were hurt, it's not just 'f--- it, here I go.'\"\nIt's why Mitchell has leaned so heavily on Mobley, trying to instill both the confidence and aggressiveness in the Cavs' youngest star.\n\"I had to find that at his age early on when I first got into the league,\" Mitchell said. \"It's a process. You're seeing him being aggressive, which we'll take. Now it's like how am I being smart with that as well?\n\"I'm in his ear nonstop. ... 'Hey, you're a threat, or there's a pass here, or stop passing the f---ing ball, there's no way player X should be able to guard you.' He has it himself, not saying it's all me. It's reinforcing that.\"\nThe Cavs also know that a reinforcement is on his way.\nGarland, still their best playmaker, is close to making his season debut, Atkinson said last week. Garland went through training camp with the Cavs' G League team and has fully recovered from his toe injury.\nBall, for his part, has already helped push the team's 10th-ranked pace, and he has recorded at least one steal in each of the past five games he has played.\n\"[This team] literally has everything that you can want in this league,\" Ball told ESPN. \"Especially the way our bigs are now. We've got modern bigs, so for me, it's just coming in and doing my job.\"\nInside the organization, though, the Cavs know their season hinges on that one young, modern big. They've been impressed by Mobley's willingness to own more of the offense, in addition to anchoring the defense. They know it might be the key to another deep playoff run.\n\"If you watch him this offseason, he's been locked in,\" Cavs president Kolby Altman said before the start of the season. \"He is really serious about taking that leap to being a top-five player in the league. ... He's grown, he's still 24 years old, but now he's becoming a grown man in terms of his body, his emotions.\n\"I think he's ready to take that next step. I say it all the time: As he goes, we go.\"", "summary": "(summarizer_error: 401 Client Error: Unauthorized for url: https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions)"}
{"theme": "sports", "title": "Are the Spurs actually a contender? Debating four early-season storylines", "url": "https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/46835724/nba-2025-2026-season-debating-early-storylines-austin-reaves-victor-wembanyama", "published": "2025-11-04T21:20:16+00:00", "cleaned_text": "Two of the prospective contenders in the East are flailing, while two in the West are scorching hot. Meanwhile, an important awards race has already turned upside-down.\nThe 2025-26 NBA season is a mere two weeks old, but that's a perfect time to start diving into the most important numbers and narratives surrounding these early surprises.\nESPN national analysts Zach Kram and Kevin Pelton debate the biggest early-season questions about Victor Wembanyama, Paolo Banchero, Trae Young, Austin Reaves, Cooper Flagg and more.\nDoes Victor Wembanyama make the San Antonio Spurs a true contender?\nPelton: The Spurs appear to be the young team that is taking the leap. Starting with an opening-night drubbing of the Dallas Mavericks, San Antonio started 5-0 for the first time in franchise history, and Victor Wembanyama rates as the league's second-best player on a per-possession basis in my wins above replacement player metric.\nThe caveat here is the schedule. Thursday's showdown with the fast-starting Miami Heat was the Spurs' first matchup against a 2025 playoff team, and they won't face an opponent who won more than a single playoff game last spring until their NBA Cup group opener against the Houston Rockets next Friday. Do you buy San Antonio's start, Zach, or do you need to see them beat somebody their own size? (Which might not be anybody, in Wemby's case.)\nKram: The simplest answer is that as long as Wembanyama continues to play like an MVP candidate, the Spurs' ceiling is as tall as he is. His PER through six games is 30.7. Before this season, there were 35 instances in NBA history in which a player posted a player efficiency rating above 30, and on average, their teams won 53.5 games.\nBut the NBA's talent pool is so deep now that one transcendent star isn't always sufficient to propel a team to the top of the standings. Those 35 instances include recent examples in which the likes of Giannis Antetokounmpo, Nikola Jokic, Anthony Davis and Russell Westbrook were stuck in the middle of the standings despite tremendous individual seasons.\nThat possibility remains likely for the Spurs, as the quality of the supporting cast surrounding Wembanyama remains unclear. Reigning Rookie of the Year Stephon Castle is averaging 20 points per game on increased efficiency while supplying excellent defense. But guards De'Aaron Fox and Dylan Harper are both hurt, as are Luke Kornet, Kelly Olynyk and Jeremy Sochan in the frontcourt.\nSan Antonio's second-ranked defense looks real: Led by Defensive Player of the Year favorite Wembanyama, the Spurs are allowing the second-fewest points in the paint, and they should get better opponent shooting luck as the season continues. Spurs opponents rank third in the NBA with a 39% mark from 3-point range.\nBut I'm more skeptical of their ninth-ranked offense, at least until Fox returns and we see the Spurs' sets and rotations with a ball-dominant All-Star at the point.\nPelton: I think that stat about 30+ PER seasons is worth investigating. There are a couple of reasons that kind of individual production is less meaningful now. First, even though PER is pegged to a consistent average of 15, heliocentric offenses mean we're seeing more players than ever top that mark.\nBetween 1963-64 and Michael Jordan's retirement from the Chicago Bulls in 1998, David Robinson was the only other player to top a 30 PER while qualifying for NBA per-game leaderboards according to Sports-Reference.com. (Jordan did it four times.) Meanwhile, three players did so in both 2021-22 and 2024-25. Antetokounmpo and Jokic were part of both groups, rounded out by first Joel Embiid and then Shai Gilgeous-Alexander.\nSo the bar is easier to clear now. Beyond that, players with a 30-plus PER through LeBron James in 2012-13 averaged 40.1 minutes per team game. Since then, because of increasing injuries, decreasing minutes averages and load management, players with 30-plus PERs average just 34.0 minutes per team game. So yes, a single star is less meaningful in wins and losses terms than it once was.\nWho is the best bounce-back candidate in the East?\nKram: The Atlanta Hawks and Orlando Magic meet in Atlanta on Tuesday night, in a rematch of a 111-107 Hawks victory in October, and both teams could use a win. The Southeast Division foes had high hopes entering the season as young teams on the rise in an Eastern Conference in flux; they ranked third and fourth in the East in ESPN's preseason rankings.\nBut after two weeks of games, both the Hawks and Magic look farther away from contention than they did last season, when both appeared in the play-in tournament. The Hawks have suffered from key absences and are 3-4 with a minus-2.9 net rating, while the 3-4 Magic rank 22nd in offensive rating and 30th in 3-point makes despite the addition of Desmond Bane.\nKevin, which ostensible contender do you believe has the best chance to bounce back and climb the still-wide-open Eastern Conference standings?\nPelton: When we first conceived this topic back in September, the idea was that we disagreed on which of Atlanta and Orlando would be the rising force in the East. (Zach liked the Hawks, while I was a Magic believer.) Now it's looking like we might both be wrong?\nI still think Orlando can right the ship. The Magic's biggest issue during their 1-4 start was getting outshot on a nightly basis, and GeniusIQ's quantified shot probability metric -- which estimates the effective field-goal percentage we should expect based on the location and type of shot, and distance to nearby defenders -- says they've been taking better shots than their opponents, when accounting for player ability.\nBane, a 41% career 3-point shooter, won't keep hitting 26% and Tyus Jones will shoot better than an effective 42% when accounting for the added value of 3s (he was at 57% eFG% the past two seasons). Am I wrong to keep the Orlando faith?\nKram: Even beyond better shooting, faith in the Magic requires a strong belief in Banchero as a true superstar and No. 1 option. He looks the part, and his surface stats have always been strong. But what does it say when the Magic have been better with Banchero off the court in every season of his career?\nThis isn't a matter of shooting luck or substitution patterns; this is a consistent pattern in an increasingly large sample of minutes. According to PBP Stats, when Banchero has played without Franz Wagner in their careers, the Magic have a minus-7.7 net rating. But the Magic thrive when Wagner plays without Banchero, with a plus-7.0 net rating.\nAdvanced stats that incorporate on/off data conclude that Banchero is merely average overall, rather than an All-NBA candidate in waiting. I don't think Orlando can grab a top seed if that's the case.\nPelton: It says that Wagner is a secret superstar, naturally! More seriously, picking the Magic to contend in the East was premised on more shooting unlocking higher-quality shots for Banchero. According to the player-neutral version of GeniusIQ's metrics, quantified shot quality, just 27% of players who attempted at least 750 shots last year took more difficult ones than Banchero.\nYet Banchero's shot quality has barely improved in the early going, and his playmaking is down. He's averaging just 7.7 potential assists per game, according to NBA Advanced Stats, down from 9.4 last year. It's up to Orlando's coaching staff to generate more ball movement for the benefit of Banchero and everyone else.\nThus far, we've focused on the Magic, but what do you make of Atlanta's slow start after a much-hyped offseason?\nKram: The biggest concern in Atlanta is health. I still believe in this team at full strength: Trae Young makes for an efficient offense all by himself, and his teammates are all good-to-great defenders who can compensate for his deficiency on that end of the floor.\nUnfortunately, the Hawks have scarcely been at full strength this season, and won't for a while longer. Dyson Daniels is the only starter who hasn't already missed time this season, and Young is out for at least a month after spraining his right knee last week. Those absences have exposed the Hawks' shallow roster, whose quality drops off dramatically after the top seven or eight players. (At least Mouhamed Gueye looks like a potential impact player off the bench.)\nTo illustrate this challenge, the Hawks' top three players -- Young, Jalen Johnson and Kristaps Porzingis -- have shared the court for just 42 minutes this year. In contrast, Orlando's Banchero-Wagner-Bane trio has 144 minutes together.\nGranted, those 42 minutes haven't gone great, as the Hawks' rebuilt roster is clearly learning to play together, and their 25th-ranked offense is in particular trouble during Young's long-term absence. But I think their ceiling remains high, if only they can all get healthy and gain some familiarity and continuity before the postseason.\nShould LeBron James play off Luka Doncic and Austin Reaves?\nKram: Another team sitting comfortably near the top of the Western Conference standings is the Los Angeles Lakers, whose 6-2 start is a surprise given that Doncic and James have combined for four appearances. But Reaves' breakout has buoyed the Lakers in his star teammates' absences. In three games without Doncic, Reaves scored 51 against the Kings, 41 against the Trail Blazers and 28 points -- the last featuring a buzzer-beating game-winner over Minnesota -- and he's averaging 31.1 points and 9.3 assists per game overall.\nMuch of the discussion around this leveling-up has centered on Reaves' upcoming unrestricted free agency -- how much money he could command next summer, and what it might mean for the Lakers' finances and team-building. But if Reaves is anywhere near this good offensively, that also carries importance right now; after all, Doncic has a history of making deep playoff runs with a capable co-star in the backcourt.\nCould Reaves play a role similar to the one Jalen Brunson and Kyrie Irving occupied in Dallas, on trips to the conference finals and Finals, respectively? James seemed like the natural No. 2 to Doncic entering this season, but as he continues to miss time with sciatica while Reaves excels, the NBA's all-time leading scorer is in danger of being Wally Pipped.\nPelton: No matter how well Jake LaRavia has played (I'm going to tell my kids this was the Lakers' big three), LeBron should probably start. However, I do think taking the ball out of Reaves' hands at this point would be a mistake. Doncic (8.7 minutes per game) is first and Reaves (7.5) sixth in the league this season in time of possession, per NBA Advanced Stats.\nThat's a dramatic change from last season, when James (5.4) spent slightly more time per game in possession than Reaves (5.2) despite both averaging the same number of minutes per game. Certainly, Reaves, a 37% career 3-point shooter, can be effective off the ball. But he's now shown enough shot creation that I think it's time for James, who's shot 39% on 3s the past two seasons, to be primarily a play finisher rather than a creator when the Lakers' starters are on the court.\nAUSTIN REAVES HITS THE @TISSOT BUZZER-BEATER!!!\n— NBA (@NBA) October 30, 2025\n🚨⏰ Your Time Defines Your Greatness. pic.twitter.com/sQfb0zr9Nl\nReaves has attempted the third-most shots in the league without an assist opportunity this season, per GeniusIQ. And his 57% eFG% on those shots ranks 13th of the 49 players with at least 50 attempts, just behind Gilgeous-Alexander. (Doncic, at 63%, is third-best in this group.) Last season, James had a 52% eFG% on shots without an assist opportunity, but improved to 67% when there was a potential assist.\nKram: I agree that it would make sense for Lakers coach JJ Redick to keep giving Reaves on-ball opportunities, especially when Doncic isn't on the court. I've been especially impressed by Reaves' passing ability and penchant for drawing fouls in those situations. (Reaves ranks third among all players this season with 9.3 made free throws per game -- just behind Doncic, in second place at 10.8.)\nDoncic and Reaves could help lighten James' workload to maintain his health throughout the rest of the season, once he returns to the court. But it's also important to note that there are still few players in the NBA who deserve more shot attempts than James, even in his 40s. Last season, James made the All-NBA second team on the strength of an elite combination of volume and efficiency. He had a 30% usage rate and 60% true shooting; the only other players to hit both marks were Antetokounmpo and MVP Gilgeous-Alexander.\nIt's not an easy answer, but this is ultimately a good problem for Redick to have. According to the DARKO projection system, Doncic is the third-most-valuable offensive player in the NBA on a per-possession basis, while Reaves and James are, fittingly, tied in 15th place.\nShould VJ Edgecombe have surpassed Cooper Flagg as the Rookie of the Year favorite?\nPelton: I'm not worried about the development of No. 1 pick Flagg, who is playing out of position for an ill-fitting Mavericks team. Still, Flagg hasn't been the most productive lottery pick from Duke thus far, with college teammate Kon Knueppel averaging 14 PPG on 22-of-51 3-point shooting.\nThat's opened the door for a real Rookie of the Year race, and No. 3 pick Edgecombe has come bursting through like the Kool-Aid Man. Playing an incredible 39 minutes per game -- no rookie has averaged more than 38.6 since LeBron in 2003-04 -- Edgecombe is averaging 20.3 PPG and 5.0 RPG while shooting better than 40% from 3-point range.\nIs the market right to already consider Edgecombe the Rookie of the Year favorite? Or is that too quick to dismiss Flagg, who did have 40 points and 10 assists in a pair of games during his first weekend as a pro?\nKram: I'd go so far as to say Edgecombe isn't the only realistic contender who can steal the Rookie of the Year trophy from the presumptive favorite. Part of Flagg's appeal was his expected all-around contribution -- which would fit this race especially well because, as you've documented, 35 of the last 38 Rookie of the Year awards have gone to the qualified player with the highest combined per-game averages in points, rebounds and assists. (The exceptions are Amar'e Stoudemire over Yao Ming in 2003, Malcolm Brogdon over Dario Saric in 2017 and Scottie Barnes over Cade Cunningham in 2022. Ming and Saric finished second in the voting, while Cunningham finished third.)\nBut two weeks into the season, Flagg trails Edgecombe by a huge margin in their combined averages, and No. 11 pick Cedric Coward (the current leader in advanced stats among rookies), No. 2 pick Harper, and No. 4 pick Knueppel are close behind.\nEven while playing point guard, Flagg has produced only 3.0 assists per game, and his Mavericks are last in the league in offensive efficiency. Both of those numbers should improve, but if Flagg isn't statistically dominant and his team isn't winning, then it would be tough to vault him ahead of Edgecombe, who could finish with better numbers on a better team.", "summary": "(summarizer_error: 401 Client Error: Unauthorized for url: https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions)"}

I knew him when he was in high school ... That might be the first time I thought about it or really realized what [my] impact was.\"\nCurry also referenced a memorable comment from his former coach, Mark Jackson, who said on an ESPN broadcast in 2015 that Curry \"ruined the game\" after young players across the country were attempting to mimic his long-range shooting style -- without his accuracy.\n\"What Mark didn't realize is he ruined the league, too,\" James laughed. \"Everyone shoots 3s now. Everyone. Sixty 3s a game, 50 3s a game. It's all Steph. It's all Steph.\"\nNash specifically mentioned Curry's mid-career leap from 646 attempted 3-pointers in a season (2014-15) to 886 the following season (2015-16) as a seminal development.\n\"You jumped 200 3s attempted,\" Nash said. \"From one season to the next, 200 3s attempted. Then, the league followed. [Damian Lillard] and Klay [Thompson]. Now it's not uncommon for three or four guys on your roster to shoot hundreds of 3s [per season].\"\nCurry credited his former general manager Bob Myers with cracking open that door.\n\"Shot quality is still ... the jury's still out in the league,\" Curry said. \"Bob Myers was the first one to tell me, 'You should shoot 15 3s a game.'

But, yes, the game has morphed like crazy.\"\n\"It's all Steph,\" James said. \"It's all Steph.\"\nThe podcast opened with a story from Nash about a preseason night when he defended a younger Curry, which convinced Nash his career was nearing its end.

So to honor the best from every stage of the postseason, let's hand out hardware to a roster of October stars.\nFrom wild-card-round sensations to World Series standouts, here are the players our ESPN MLB panel of experts voted as the best of the best at every position along with some award hardware for the brightest stars of October.\n2025 All-October Team\nCatcher: Cal Raleigh, Seattle Mariners\nWhy he's here: Raleigh's record-setting regular season continued right into October as he belted five home runs and posted a 1.081 OPS before Seattle's postseason run ended in Game 7 of the ALCS.\nHonorable mentions: Alejandro Kirk, Toronto Blue Jays; Will Smith, Los Angeles Dodgers\n1B: Vladimir Guerrero Jr., Toronto Blue Jays\nWhy he's here: If the Blue Jays would have won one more game during the World Series, the introduction of this story would have been all about Guerrero and his incredible October exploits. The Blue Jays' superstar hit an incredible .412 with a 1.330 OPS during the postseason, delivering signature moment after signature moment while leading Toronto to where it hadn't been in three decades.\nHonorable mentions: Michael Busch, Chicago Cubs; Josh Naylor, Seattle Mariners\n2B: Nico Hoerner, Chicago Cubs\nWhy he's here: In a down year for the position, Hoerner had the highest OPS (.973) of all second baseman during the postseason while playing stellar defense as the Cubs dispatched the Padres and went on to force a Game 5 against the Brewers in the NLDS.\nHow little production did second basemen provide this October? One voter chose Miguel Rojas as his pick for the position solely based on one all-important Game 7 swing.\nHonorable mentions: Jorge Polanco, Seattle Mariners; Miguel Rojas, Los Angeles Dodgers\n3B: Ernie Clement, Toronto Blue Jays\nWhy he's here: Clement was instrumental in the Blue Jays' run, providing consistent production at the plate and solid defense on the field. His 1.032 postseason OPS topped all third baseman and his 30 hits were not only the most of any player this October but set a major league record for most hits in a single postseason.\nHonorable mention: Jose Ramirez, Cleveland Guardians\nSS: Andres Gimenez, Toronto Blue Jays\nWhy he's here: The pickings were pretty slim at shortstop and Gimenez earned this spot more for his clutch hits than his overall numbers.\nHonorable mention: Trevor Story, Boston Red Sox\nOF: Addison Barger, Toronto Blue Jays\nOF: Aaron Judge, New York Yankees\nOF: Jackson Chourio, Milwaukee Brewers\nWhy they're here: If you didn't know the name Addison Barger before this, you do now. The 25-year-old, who was called up from the majors in mid-April, had a breakout postseason, slashing .367/.411/.583 with three home runs, nine RBIs and a 1.025 OPS while also making a number of diving catches in right field. But the moment that will ensure Barger's name is remembered? His pinch-hit grand slam in Game 1 of the World Series -- which came after he had slept on a teammate's pullout couch the night before.\nJudge's postseason performances had long been under scrutiny because of his checkered playoff history compared to his stellar regular-season numbers. But that should all be put to rest after this year, as he accumulated 13 hits in 26 at-bats over seven games and finally met his October moment in the form of a monster three-run, tying home run in a crucial ALDS Game 3 to keep New York's season alive.\nThe 21-year-old Chourio came out swinging this October, helping Milwaukee to a hard-won NLDS victory over the Cubs, with a double and two-run single in the first game and a three-run home run -- which he hit off a 101.4 mph fastball, the fastest pitch for a postseason home run in the pitch tracking era -- to cement another victory in Game 2. Though he didn't light the world on fire when the top-seeded Brewers were swept in the NLCS, Chourio did hit their lone home run and drove in half of their runs in the series.\nHonorable mention: Julio Rodriguez, Seattle Mariners; Kerry Carpenter, Detroit Tigers\nDH: Shohei Ohtani, Los Angeles Dodgers\nWhy he's here: It was something of a mixed October for Ohtani, with his .254/.397/.714 playoff slash line heavily carried by a couple of standout games. But those performances just so happened to be two of the best single-game showings in the history of October baseball: a three-home run game (while pitching a gem on the mound) in L.A.'s NLCS clincher and an all-time World Series Game 3 in which he got on base nine times in the Dodgers' 18-inning triumph.\nHonorable mention: George Springer, Toronto Blue Jays\nSP: Yoshinobu Yamamoto, Los Angeles Dodgers\nSP: Trey Yesavage, Toronto Blue Jays\nWhy they're here: There was simply no better pitcher in the sport than Yamamoto this October, as the Dodgers ace authored one of the best postseasons in recent history. Before he won World Series MVP honors by winning three games in the Fall Classic, Yamamoto was masterful in a complete-game NLCS Game 2 gem against the Milwaukee Brewers.\nYesavage bursted onto the scene this October in a way rarely seen before, becoming the World Series Game 1 starter just six weeks after making his MLB debut. He provided Toronto with two of the best starts of the postseason -- Game 2 against the Yankees and Game 5 against the Dodgers.\nHonorable mentions: Tarik Skubal, Detroit Tigers; Blake Snell, Los Angeles Dodgers; Tyler Glasnow, Los Angeles Dodgers; Cam Schlittler, New York Yankees; Cristopher Sanchez, Philadelphia Phillies\nRP: Jacob Misiorowski, Milwaukee Brewers\nRP: Will Vest, Detroit Tigers\nWhy they're here: Misiorowski played a crucial role on the mound for Milwaukee as a starter coming out of the pen to throw bulk innings of high-leverage relief -- with his first eight career postseason pitches clocking in at 102 mph or faster. In 12 innings over three games, he totaled 16 strikeouts while giving up six hits and three runs (two earned) and issuing three walks.\nVest was nearly unhittable in October as Detroit's primary closer, giving up only two hits -- and zero runs, for a 0.00 postseason ERA -- and striking out nine over eight innings to help the Tigers beat Cleveland in the wild-card round and stay competitive against Seattle in the ALDS before they ultimately lost in a 15-inning Game 5.\nHonorable mentions: Roki Sasaki, Los Angeles Dodgers; Andres Munoz, Seattle Mariners; Louis Varland, Toronto Blue Jays\nAll-October award winners\nOctober MVP: Vladimir Guerrero Jr.\nPitcher of the month: Yoshinobu Yamamoto\nBest October introduction: Trey Yesavage, Addison Barger\nClutch performer: Yamamoto", "summary": "(summarizer_error: 401 Client Error: Unauthorized for url: https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions)"}

There is definitely no Shohei Ohtani. But although there might not be a player who will inspire people to track the flight paths of private jets on social media, it's an intriguing class of free agents nonetheless -- one especially deep in power hitters.\nLet's look at 13 of the most interesting free agents, assuming a few likely player opt-outs, and some potential best fits for each player. We'll leave out some of the top relievers -- Edwin Diaz (opt-out), Robert Suarez (opt-out), Devin Williams -- and instead focus on the top position players and starting pitchers available this winter.\nPlayers are ranked in order of their Baseball-Reference WAR from 2025.\nCody Bellinger, OF/1B (opt-out)\n2025 stats: .272/.334/.480, 29 HR, 98 RBIs, 13 SB, 5.0 WAR\n2026 age: 30\nBest fit: New York Mets\nBellinger surprisingly tops the list in 2025 WAR, although that doesn't by any means suggest he's going to get the biggest contract. Indeed, although he offers positional versatility with his ability to play all three outfield positions as well as first base, teams will be skeptical of his 2025 numbers since he hit .302 with 18 home runs and a .909 OPS at Yankee Stadium with its short porch compared with .241 with 11 home runs and a .715 OPS on the road. Bellinger works for the Mets both in center field -- heck, they were playing 33-year-old infielder Jeff McNeil out there at times -- and at first, if they don't re-sign Pete Alonso.\nAnother possible fit: New York Yankees\nA reunion with the Yankees is possible, but if the Yankees are committed to Jasson Dominguez in left field and give Spencer Jones a shot in center, they're going to be reluctant to give Bellinger a long-term contract. Given some of their recent returns on long deals (DJ LeMahieu, Aaron Hicks, Giancarlo Stanton), they probably don't want to get sucked into another big contract for a non-superstar player, no matter how good Bellinger was in 2025.\nKyle Schwarber, DH\n2025 stats: .240/.365/.563, 56 HR, 132 RBIs, 4.7 WAR\n2026 age: 33\nBest fit: Philadelphia Phillies\nEveryone expects Schwarber to return to the Phillies, coming off his 56-homer season and with his added value as one of the best teammates in the game. Nothing is guaranteed, however, and president of baseball operations Dave Dombrowski is balancing a lot of decisions this offseason. J.T. Realmuto is also a free agent, Ranger Suarez is a free agent and Zack Wheeler's return is a question, plus the team in general is getting older. But it's still a team in a championship window -- if Schwarber remains in the lineup.\nAnother possible fit: Mets\nThink the Mets would love to steal Schwarber away from the Phillies? Addition and then subtraction from your rival. Would Schwarber leave the Phillies for the enemy? Players are a lot less loyal than we'd like to believe. Starling Marte was the Mets' primary DH and he's a free agent, plus consider: The Mets signed Soto and Alonso had a better season -- yet they still scored two fewer runs than in 2024. It was an above-average offense, fifth in the NL in runs, but it wasn't a great offense. Adding Schwarber could take it to the next level.\nRanger Suarez, LHP\n2025 stats: 12-8. 3.20 ERA, 157 IP, 154 H, 38 BB, 151 SO, 4.7 WAR\n2026 age: 30\nBest fit: Detroit Tigers\nSuarez has been a steady and underrated pitcher since 2021, with a 3.25 ERA over the past five seasons, relying on a six-pitch repertoire that allows him to overcome below-average fastball velocity. He always gets dinged up at some point, so he's a 150-inning pitcher as opposed to a 180-inning guy, but that still makes him a good fit for the Tigers, who need rotation depth, should have plenty of room in the payroll and could trade Tarik Skubal (sorry, Tigers fans).\nAnother possible fit: Toronto Blue Jays\nSuarez will have a lot of interest even though he lacks that blistering fastball. Indeed, his lack of No. 1-starter pedigree will bring more teams into the bidding, even if he's expected to get a nine-figure deal. The Blue Jays are an interesting fit here. Chris Bassitt and Max Scherzer are free agents; Shane Bieber has a player option; and Kevin Gausman is a free agent after the 2026 season. They'll be looking for some long-term stability in the rotation.\nKyle Tucker, OF\n2025 stats: .266/.377/.464, 22 HR, 73 RBIs, 25 SB, 4.5 WAR\n2026 age: 29\nBest fit: Los Angeles Dodgers\nIf healthy, Tucker would have led this list in WAR -- he was hitting .291/.395/.537 for the Chicago Cubs at the end of June when he suffered a fracture in his right hand, which he tried to play through. But he hit just .225 the rest of the way. Indeed, he's projected to get the biggest contract of the offseason, perhaps as much as $400 million.\nAs good as he has been, there are some Anthony Rendon vibes here: Tucker has now been injured two years in a row (he also missed much of September with a calf injury); he's turning 29; his speed/range Statcast metrics aren't great (26th percentile in both categories); and he's not a \"face of the franchise\" type of personality, which you normally expect for $400 million.\nCould the Dodgers absorb another huge contract? Well, why not? The Dodgers are the best fit of \"will spend money\" and \"have need,\" considering they got nothing from left field in 2025 and suddenly have concerns about Mookie Betts' long-term impact at the plate after his subpar (for him) season.\nAnother possible fit: San Francisco Giants\nThe Giants, of course, have been trying to land an elite offensive player in free agency forever -- finally trading for Rafael Devers last June. Giants corner outfielders hit just .237/.309/.378 with 37 home runs and 12 stolen bases, so adding Tucker to the lineup would give them a much-needed second lefty power hitter (with rookie slugger Bryce Eldridge likely to take over at first base, too).\nFramber Valdez, LHP\n2025 stats: 13-11, 3.66 ERA, 192 IP, 171 H, 68 BB, 187 SO, 3.8 WAR\n2026 age: 32\nBest fit: Baltimore Orioles\nAt some point, the Orioles will sign the front-line starter they need, right? Right?! They finished 24th in rotation ERA at 4.65 and had seven starters who made at least 10 starts in 2025 -- and four of them had ERAs over 5.00. That's not going to cut it in the AL East. Trevor Rogers (1.81 ERA in 18 starts) did emerge in the second half, and Kyle Bradish returned from Tommy John surgery at the end of the season, but the Orioles have lacked that durable No. 1-type starter and Valdez is second in innings pitched over the past four seasons.\nAnother possible fit: Houston Astros\nThe Astros have the need to bring Valdez back as the rotation was mostly a mess in 2025 aside from him and Hunter Brown. The payroll, however, looks pretty maxed out with the likes of Jose Altuve, Carlos Correa, Yordan Alvarez, Christian Walker and Josh Hader (they're also paying Lance McCullers Jr. and Cristian Javier a combined $39 million in 2026). Don't rule out a return, but the Astros have let other stars leave in free agency -- Correa, Alex Bregman, George Springer, Gerrit Cole and Justin Verlander.\nEugenio Suarez, 3B\n2025 stats: .228/.298/.526, 49 HR, 118 RBIs, 3.6 WAR\n2026 age: 34\nBest fit: Athletics\nThe A's aren't often included in lists like this one -- especially for a player coming off 49 home runs -- but a lot of factors could push Suarez to the A's: his age, his below-average OBP and strikeout rate, his subpar production after he was traded to Seattle. The A's started nine players at third base in 2025 (players who combined for just 10 home runs), and Suarez would certainly bring power and durability -- he has missed just seven games the past three seasons. He's also a good clubhouse guy who would fit in with the team's younger players. The A's surprised people by signing Luis Severino last offseason, so they could land Suarez in a similar scenario.\nOther possible fits: Tigers, Milwaukee Brewers, Arizona Diamondbacks, Seattle Mariners\nThe Brewers (.234, 11 HR, .650 OPS) and Tigers (.221, 11 HR, .629) both made the playoffs despite subpar production at third base. Milwaukee loves high-contact offensive players, so maybe Suarez doesn't fit there, and Detroit might not want to add another high-strikeout rate guy in the middle of the lineup on top of Riley Greene. The D-backs and Mariners are familiar with Suarez -- he played for each in 2025 -- but both have young players in Jordan Lawlar and Colt Emerson whom they could play at third.\nAlex Bregman, 3B (opt-out)\n2025 stats: .273/.360/.462, 18 HR, 62 RBIs, 3.5 WAR\n2026 age: 32\nBest fit: Boston Red Sox\nBregman hit free agency last year and didn't sign until the middle of February, a three-year, $120 million deal with opt-outs after both 2025 and 2026. He played well enough with the Red Sox that he's likely to test free agency, even though a quad strain limited him to 114 games. After a hot start, he didn't hit nearly as well after returning in July -- .250/.338/.386. The big surprise is that the pull-happy Bregman hit better on the road (.875 OPS) than at Fenway (.761 OPS).\nStill, the Red Sox remain the best fit. He was an important veteran presence for Boston's young position players, and he's a right-handed bat in a lineup otherwise heavy in lefties (Jarren Duran, Roman Anthony, Wilyer Abreu, Masataka Yoshida). Bregman's age presents some risk on a long-term deal, but although his speed metrics are sinking (17th percentile), he still has good range at third base and brought his OBP back up after it dropped to .315 in 2024.\nOther possible fits: Tigers, Yankees, Phillies\nBregman's contact ability makes him a likely fit for the Tigers -- and he'll be too expensive for the Brewers. The interesting long shot candidates would be the Yankees and Phillies. The Yankees have Ryan McMahon under contract, but he posted a .641 OPS after coming over from the Colorado Rockies at the trade deadline and his strikeout issues are a concern. The Phillies have Alec Bohm in his final year of team control, but Bohm produced just 1.3 WAR in 2025 and the Phillies are a little tired of his lack of postseason production (.225, 2 HR, 14 RBIs in 38 playoff games). Bregman's fire might be what the Phillies need.\nPete Alonso, 1B (opt-out)\n2025 stats: .272/.347/.524, 38 HR, 126 RBIs, 3.4 WAR\n2026 age: 31\nBest fit: Mets\nAlonso's stature -- and ability to hit home runs and drive in runs -- means he's the highest-profile free agent alongside Schwarber, even if his WAR puts him lower on this list. Alonso has averaged 42 home runs per 162 games throughout his career, and his durability is one of his selling points -- he hasn't missed a game the past two seasons. Alonso was a free agent last year and there wasn't much interest, so he went back to the Mets on a deal that gave him an opt-out and responded with a better campaign in 2025.\nWill there be more demand this offseason? Perhaps. But Alonso is a 31-year-old first baseman who is a below-average defender. He has elite power but not elite on-base percentages. That all makes him a \"high risk\" category, and he's not quite in the class of Vladimir Guerrero Jr., Freddie Freeman or Matt Olson, the first basemen who received big nine-figure deals since 2022. It's hard to envision Alonso leaving the Mets, but president of baseball operations David Stearns won't overpay to bring him back -- and Alonso might not be so willing to give the Mets a sweetheart of a deal this time around.\nOther possible fits: Miami Marlins, Washington Nationals\nThe Texas Rangers didn't get the output they wanted from Jake Burger; the Red Sox could move on from Triston Casas; and the Phillies (if they don't sign Schwarber) and Atlanta Braves might consider Alonso as a DH, but let's toss out the Marlins. Their first basemen hit just .234 with 15 home runs. They haven't had a 2-WAR first baseman since Justin Bour in 2017 or a 3-WAR first baseman since Derrek Lee in 2002. Teams always think they can fill first base with adequate offense, but the Marlins are proof that's not always the case. Alonso is also from Florida, which might help. A more realistic long shot might be the Nationals, who need a big bopper and have plenty of room in the payroll.\nBo Bichette, 2B/3B/SS\n2025 stats: .311/.357/.483, 18 HR, 94 RBIs, 3.4 WAR\n2026 age: 28\nBest fit: Giants\nBichette's free agency will be fascinating. Given his poor defensive metrics at shortstop, it's almost a certainty teams will be looking at him as a second or third baseman rather than a shortstop -- even the Blue Jays (the team he has been with his entire career), who would move Andres Gimenez to shortstop. That's not a bad thing for Bichette, as it opens up his possible destinations to more teams if he's willing to change positions.\nAlthough he is a .294 hitter, it will be interesting to see how he ages: He already doesn't run well (21st percentile in speed) and he doesn't walk much, so his offensive production is heavily reliant on his batting average. We mentioned the Giants as a potential fit for Kyle Tucker. The same goes for Bichette, as Giants second basemen hit just .216/.273/.342.\nAnother possible fit: Kansas City Royals\nOK, can the Royals realistically afford to sign Bichette? Probably not, but a double-play combination of Bobby Witt Jr. and Bichette would be a lot of fun, and Bichette's style of hitting would be a good fit for that park. Royals second basemen hit just .236 with 11 home runs, and we know the lineup needs something else. The Royals aren't the Pittsburgh Pirates or Tampa Bay Rays. They will spend some money -- although there isn't much wiggle room based on the 2025 payroll -- and there is a contention window right now with their current rotation.\nJosh Naylor, 1B\n2025 stats: .295/.353/.462, 20 HR, 92 RBIs, 30 SB, 3.1 WAR\n2026 age: 29\nBest fit: Mariners\nNaylor was the perfect fit for the Mariners, who had not only struggled at first base but also needed a more contact-oriented hitter like Naylor for the middle of the lineup when they traded for him at this year's deadline. He unveiled one of the most surprising secret weapons, going 30-for-32 as a base stealer despite being one of the slowest runners in baseball. Although many hitters are reluctant to sign with the Mariners, Naylor loves hitting at T-Mobile Park, with a career line of .304/.335/.534. The Mariners should have room to bring him back.\nAnother possible fit: Rangers\nRangers first basemen/DHs combined for a .657 OPS -- only the Rockies were worse. Texas still has Jake Burger and Joc Pederson (who will probably exercise his $18.5 million player option), but both had sub-.290 OBPs, so the Rangers will consider upgrading.\nDylan Cease, RHP\n2025 stats: 8-12, 4.55 ERA, 168 IP, 152 H, 71 BB, 215 SO, 1.1 WAR\n2026 age: 30\nBest fit: Cubs\nCease's eventual contract will far outpace his ERA and low WAR from 2025. Teams will focus on the power arm (average fastball of 97.1 mph), the high strikeout rate and the durability (five straight seasons with at least 32 starts). A return to the Cubs would be full circle as they originally drafted Cease in the sixth round out of high school in 2014 before trading him to the Chicago White Sox in the Jose Quintana deal.\nThe 2025 Cubs were a prime example of why teams prefer those power arms in the postseason. With Cade Horton injured, Matthew Boyd and Shota Imanaga were their top two starters, two lefties without high K rates. They have plenty of payroll room to make a big rotation signing.\nAnother possible fit: San Diego Padres (and every other contender)\nWith Cease and Michael King (who has a player opt-out) in free agency, the Padres would have Nick Pivetta, Yu Darvish, Randy Vasquez, Joe Musgrove (returning from Tommy John surgery) and perhaps Mason Miller in their rotation -- and the options thin out in a hurry after that. But is there room in a payroll that is already pushing $200 million heading into the offseason?\nZac Gallen, RHP\n2025 stats: 13-15, 4.83 ERA, 192 IP, 176 H, 66 BB, 175 SO, 1.1 WAR\n2026 age: 30\nBest fit: Diamondbacks\nLike Cease, Gallen is hitting free agency with a high ERA. Unlike Cease, he averages 93.5 mph with his fastball instead of 97. Gallen's home run rate nearly doubled from 0.8 per nine innings in 2024 to 1.5 in 2025, and his strikeout rate plummeted to a career-low 21.5%, a notable 5-percentage-points decline from his career rate entering the season. He did pitch better the final two months with a 3.32 ERA. Still, maybe some of the questions push Gallen back to the Diamondbacks, who will enter the offseason down him, Merrill Kelly and Corbin Burnes (Tommy John surgery) from their initial 2025 rotation.\nAnother possible fit: Los Angeles Angels\nDoes anyone want to play for the Angels? Their recent free agent signings have been more of the third-tier type, but they have room in the payroll and two pitchers from their 2025 rotation hitting free agency in Tyler Anderson and Kyle Hendricks. They signed Yusei Kikuchi to a three-year, $63 million deal last offseason and might do something similar this offseason with a starter like Gallen.\nMunetaka Murakami, 3B/1B (Japan)\n2025 stats: .286/.392/.659, 24 HR, 52 RBIs\n2026 age: 26\nBest fit: Mariners\nA big left-handed slugger, Murakami has been a star in Japan since he hit 36 home runs as a 19-year-old in 2019. He followed that up with a career-high 56 home runs in 2022. He missed time this past season with an oblique injury but hit 24 home runs in 69 games. He does strike out a concerning amount -- 168 times in 140 games in 2023 and 180 times in 143 games in 2024 -- so projects as more of a low-average, 30-homer slugger. Murakami's defense is considered below average at both corner positions, but his age helps make him an attractive free agent.\nWe mentioned Colt Emerson as a replacement for Eugenio Suarez at third base for the Mariners, but a year in Triple-A wouldn't hurt, and Emerson could then take over at shortstop in 2027. That leaves Murakami as a fit for third base, or a backup option to Josh Naylor at first base. The Mariners have certainly shown they're OK with strikeouts if it comes with power.\nAnother possible fit: Dodgers\nThe Dodgers? Hey, you have to consider the Dodgers a possibility for any Japanese player. They obviously have Freddie Freeman locked into first base and have a $10 million option on Max Muncy, but note that Murakami did play a few games in the outfield in 2025. Given their hole in left field, maybe they fake left-field defense with Murakami for a year and then have him replace Muncy at third base in 2027. In the bigger picture, the Dodgers had the oldest group of position players in 2025. Only Andy Pages was younger than 30 among the top 11 regulars. They need to get younger, and Murakami is younger -- and less expensive to sign -- than Kyle Tucker.", "summary": "(summarizer_error: 401 Client Error: Unauthorized for url: https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions)"}

But can a player win an NHL award in that span?\nThere's plenty of runway left for dramatic shifts in statistics and the standings. But this is the time of year when narratives are planted in the minds of awards voters. An 18-year-old rookie sensation who reenergizes a franchise in his first dozen games isn't all that far off from a film playing to standing ovations at Cannes, months before becoming an Oscar nominee.\nFirst impressions matter, and the inaugural NHL Awards Watch of the 2025-26 season is a good indication of how impressed the voters currently are with the early field of contenders.\nWe've polled a wide selection of Professional Hockey Writers Association voters anonymously to get a sense of where the wind is blowing for the current leaders. We've made sure it's a cross section from the entire league, trying to gain as many perspectives as possible.\nKeep in mind that the PHWA votes for the Hart, Norris, Calder, Selke and Lady Byng finalists, broadcasters vote for the Jack Adams and general managers handle the Vezina.\nAll stats are from Hockey-Reference.com, Natural Stat Trick and Evolving Hockey.\nJump ahead:\nRoss | Richard | Hart\nNorris | Selke | Vezina\nCalder | Byng | Adams\nArt Ross Trophy (points leader)\nClick here for the updated point-scoring standings.\nMaurice 'Rocket' Richard Trophy\nClick here for the updated goal-scoring standings.\nHart Trophy (MVP)\nLeader: Jack Eichel, C, Vegas Golden Knights\nFinalists: Cale Makar, D, Colorado Avalanche; Mark Scheifele, C, Winnipeg Jets\nEichel was the player of the month for October in the NHL. He has been the most valuable player so far this season in the minds of our voters.\nThe Golden Knights star earned 42% of the first-place votes after dominating the first 11 games of the season. Eichel had 19 points (8 goals, 11 assists) overall in that span. He had six multipoint games, including two four-point games. Entering Monday night, Eichel was five points ahead of Mitch Marner among Vegas scorers. His reputation as a \"200-foot player\" has also been slowly coagulating, as Eichel finished fifth for the Selke Trophy last season. The Golden Knights average 2.02 goals against per 60 minutes with Eichel on the ice.\nEichel has received significant Hart Trophy support just twice in his career, finishing eighth in 2019-20 with the Buffalo Sabres and fifth last season for Vegas. He earned two first-place votes in 2024-25. That number will grow significantly if his success, and that of his team, continues unabated this season.\nBut it's early.\n\"It's a wide-open race after 10 games,\" one voter concluded. \"Lots of guys having incredible impacts on the scoreboard and tilting the ice in favor of their respective teams.\"\nMakar received the second-most first-place votes (19%), which is surprising on a couple of levels. For example: He's a defenseman and this is the Hart Trophy. The last defenseman to win league MVP was Chris Pronger of the St. Louis Blues back in 2000. That's also the last time a defenseman was even a finalist for the Hart.\nMakar's candidacy is also surprising because Nathan MacKinnon, at last check, is still a member of the Colorado Avalanche. Through 13 games, MacKinnon led the Avs in goals (10) and points (19). Makar had 4 goals and 14 assists for 18 points in that span. MacKinnon earned 10% of the first-place votes from our panel.\nMacKinnon has been as relevant to the Hart Trophy voting as defensemen have been alien to it, winning league MVP in 2023-24 and finishing in the top four in the voting five total times since 2017-18.\n\"His 5-on-5 numbers so far are absurd,\" a MacKinnon voter quipped.\nBut overall, it's Makar that has the louder early MVP buzz. Keep in mind that there might be room for two Avs in the MVP race: MacKinnon was fourth for the Hart last season, but Makar finished two spots behind him at sixth.\n\"As great as MacKinnon is, Makar is that team's engine,\" one voter opined.\nScheifele's explosive first 12 games earned him the third-most first-place votes (15% overall) from our panel. The Winnipeg star had nine goals and 11 assists, and registered points in 11 of his 12 appearances. Entering Monday night, his 20 points led all scorers, powering the Jets up the standings in the Central Division.\nApparently, Scheifele really wants to make an early-season impression on Team Canada management after his 4 Nations Face-Off snub. The Jets are certainly benefiting from it.\n\"It'll be difficult for him to maintain this ranking, but he's the best performer on a fantastic team,\" a Scheifele voter declared.\nOther players who received first-place MVP votes from our panel: Leon Draisaitl (Edmonton Oilers), Jack Hughes (New Jersey Devils) and Dylan Larkin (Detroit Red Wings). Draisaitl, who won his lone MVP award in 2019-20, was second for the Hart last season behind Connor Hellebuyck.\nAmong the players that made voters' ballots but didn't get a first-place vote: Macklin Celebrini (San Jose Sharks) and Sidney Crosby (Pittsburgh Penguins).\nNorris Trophy (top defenseman)\nLeader: Cale Makar, Colorado Avalanche\nFinalists: Mike Matheson, Montreal Canadiens; Josh Morrissey, Winnipeg Jets\nIn the Norris Trophy race, Cale Makar is like Usain Bolt ... with a rocket strapped to his back.\n\"It's not particularly close,\" one voter argued.\nMakar earned all but one first-place vote from our panelists. Heading into Monday night, his 18 points are seven better than any other defenseman. He has skated to a plus-12 and is averaging 25:27 per game. He's second in the NHL in goals above replacement (6.4), per Evolving Hockey.\nMakar is seeking his second straight Norris Trophy win -- and third overall -- having earned 92% of the first-place votes last season. He has been a finalist for the Norris for five straight seasons.\n\"Makar's simply on another planet. That $20 million cap hit in two years is somehow going to be a bargain,\" another voter predicted.\nThe defenseman that prevented a unanimous decision for Makar? Canadiens veteran Matheson, who earned one first-place vote. The 31-year-old has seven points in his first 12 games for the surging Habs, playing with Noah Dobson on the team's top pairing. Matheson is one of Montreal's primary penalty killers as well.\nOf the players mentioned most prominently down the ballot, Morrissey earned the most support. The Jets defenseman had 11 points (1 goal, 10 assists) in his first 12 games, skating to a plus-12 while playing 24:35 per game on average. Morrissey was fourth in the Norris Trophy voting last season.\nAmong the other defensemen earning support from our voters: Gustav Forsling (Florida Panthers), Adam Fox (New York Rangers), Jake Sanderson (Ottawa Senators), Shea Theodore (Vegas Golden Knights) and Zach Werenski (Columbus Blue Jackets).\n\"Other guys will be in the conversation all season,\" one voter said.\nCalder Trophy (top rookie)\nLeader: Matthew Schaefer, D, New York Islanders\nFinalists: Ivan Demidov, RW, Montreal Canadiens; Emmitt Finnie, LW, Detroit Red Wings\nAs one voter put it: \"Is this a real question? It's Matthew Schaefer.\"\nThe Calder is a unique award. There are factors that go beyond stats and narrative -- and Schaefer more than fulfills both of those criteria, by the way -- like expectations. What's to be expected from an 18-year-old defending against NHL players a few months after an injury-limited, 17-game season in the Ontario Hockey League? What's to be expected from a player selected first overall in the NHL draft, setting the bar considerably higher for Schaefer than for prospects selected later in the draw?\nSchaefer is surpassing those expectations so far but also has something else going for him: That transformative alchemy that an outstanding rookie can provide to a franchise marinating in ennui. From the moment Schaefer was drafted, it was clear that his charisma and enthusiasm were infectious. After a dozen games, the Islanders have a different energy, and it's difficult not to trace that directly to the joy of Schaefer.\n\"Is there a more fun player in the league to watch right now than this kid?\" one voter asked.\nHe's not just a great story. Statistically, he's been the league's best rookie so far: 10 points in 12 games (5 goals and 5 assists), tied for the lead among Calder-eligible players entering Monday night's action. He has earned five points at even strength and five on the power play while skating 21:56 per game on average, easily the most ice time logged among rookies.\n\"Position matters. So does ice time. And Schaefer is logging more than two minutes per game more than any other rookie,\" one voter explained.\nAnd he's already making history, too. On Sunday, Schaefer became the youngest defenseman in NHL history with a multigoal game, moving in front of Hall of Famer Bobby Orr (18 years, 248 days on Nov. 23, 1966).\nAs good as Schaefer's been, he earned only 81% of the first-place votes. The other first-place votes were garnered by Canadiens dynamo Ivan Demidov. The 19-year-old winger was tied with Schaefer atop the rookie scoring list after the weekend, with 3 goals and 7 assists in 12 games. That's while averaging 13:59 in ice time, fourth among rookie forwards.\n\"Demidov is a very close second,\" one Schaefer voter admitted.\nOthers acknowledged Demidov's brilliance so far but saw the Calder picture differently.\n\"Ivan Demidov has been spectacular, but at this point, this race is not particularly close,\" one voter declared.\n\"Schaefer has been otherworldly, but Demidov will have his moment to push,\" another voter predicted.\nIt's clearly a two-player race at this point. The only other player prominently mentioned by our panel was Emmitt Finnie, one of the biggest surprises of the season so far for the Red Wings.\nAs much as Schaefer was on everyone's radar to start the season, Finnie was off it: a seventh-round pick in 2023 who spent more time in the WHL than the AHL over the past two seasons. But after posting 84 points in 55 games for Kamloops in 2024-25, the 20-year-old earned a shot to establish himself in the Detroit lineup. He found a home playing with Dylan Larkin and Lucas Raymond, and has 4 goals and 4 assists through 13 games this season.\nOther rookies getting some support so far include Minnesota Wild defenseman Zeev Buium, St. Louis Blues forward Jimmy Snuggerud and Carolina Hurricanes defenseman Alexander Nikishin.\nBut right now, it's Schaefer vs. Demidov.\nVezina Trophy (top goaltender)\nNote: The NHL's general managers vote for this award.\nLeader: Logan Thompson, Washington Capitals\nFinalists: Jakub Dobes, Montreal Canadiens; Connor Hellebuyck, Winnipeg Jets\nThere were certainly some skeptics of Thompson before the season. After being acquired from the Golden Knights in the 2024 offseason, he had an astonishing 2024-25 campaign for the Capitals: 31-6-6 with a .910 save percentage and a 2.49 goals-against average in 43 appearances. But that wasn't enough to impress the league's general managers, who placed him fourth in last season's Vezina vote.\nHis record isn't quite as sterling so far this season, but his stats are even better. Through eight games, he's 5-3-0 with a .935 save percentage and a 1.51 goals-against average, leading the NHL in both categories heading into Monday's action.\n\"He has quietly been spectacular for the Capitals,\" one voter noted.\nThompson is playing with some additional pressure on him, too: trying to make the cut for the Canadian Olympic team ahead of the 2026 men's tournament in Italy.\n\"At this point, if he doesn't make Canada's Olympic team, it is for something other than his play,\" one Canadian-born voter surmised. \"He is the best Canadian goaltender, and it's not particularly close.\"\nThompson earned 33% of the first-place votes. Hellebuyck and Dobes each earned around 24% of the first-place votes to round out the top three.\nDobes is having a 2024-25 Thompson-esque start for the Habs based on wins and losses, going 6-0-0 in six appearances. His numbers are stellar (.930 save percentage, 1.97 goals-against average) and significantly better than his crease-mate Sam Montembeault (.839 save percentage).\n\"We can't ignore the start by Jakub Dobes in Montreal,\" one voter argued.\nWith the Canadiens sprinting out of the gate, Dobes is getting a lot of Vezina love -- oddly, he didn't get any traction on the Calder ballots. Maybe there's a learning curve here about Dobes still being a rookie despite playing 16 games last season?\nHellebuyck is trying to win his third straight Vezina Trophy. The last goalie to go back-to-back-to-back was the legendary Dominik Hasek of the Buffalo Sabres (1996-99). Hellebuyck won last season's Vezina in a total rout, getting 31 out of 32 first-place votes. (The only other goalie to earn one: Andrei Vasilevskiy.) He's crushing it again so far for the Jets: 6-3-0 with a .921 save percentage and a 2.34 goals-against average in nine games.\n\"It's early and some goalies are off to a great start, but so is Hellebuyck,\" a voter concluded. \"Until proven otherwise, he is still the best in the league.\"\nAnother goalie who received multiple first-place votes was Thatcher Demko of the Vancouver Canucks, who is healthy and playing well, with a .918 save percentage and a 2.41 goals-against average. Demko is on a mission to play himself into the Team USA goalie battery for the 2026 Olympics.\n\"Demko has been back to his form. He should be in the conversation for the U.S.,\" one voter opined.\nOther goalies who received first-place votes were Spencer Knight of the Chicago Blackhawks and Lukas Dostal of the Anaheim Ducks, the latter of whom entered Monday as the NHL's leader in goals saved above expected (11.1), per Money Puck.\nSelke Trophy (best defensive forward)\nLeader: Nick Suzuki, C, Montreal Canadiens\nFinalists: Anthony Cirelli, C, Tampa Bay Lightning; Nico Hischier, C, New Jersey Devils; Jordan Staal, C, Carolina Hurricanes\nIt has become somewhat of an informal tradition in the NHL Awards Watch to have roughly the population of Saskatoon nominated for the Selke in the first month of voting. OK, we're being slightly hyperbolic, but no less than 10 different players received at least one first-place vote each.\nIf there's one award that doesn't benefit from a small sample, it's the Selke.\n\"It's too early to make any real sense of the numbers defensively,\" one voter concluded.\nThrowing the race into more chaos was the preseason injury to Florida Panthers star Aleksander Barkov, who has won the Selke in back-to-back seasons and three times overall. Without that default choice, the field is wide open.\nThere is, however, a clear leader. Suzuki was 13th for the Selke in each of the past two seasons but earned 24% of the first-place votes here. He's off to an outstanding offensive start for Montreal, with 18 points in his first 12 games, but his defensive metrics are exemplary. The Canadiens are averaging just 1.03 goals against per 60 minutes with Suzuki on the ice.\n\"He does a lot for the Habs and deserves Selke love,\" one voter argued.\nWe listed three finalists behind Suzuki because they all earned the same number of first-place votes, around 14% each.\nCirelli was a Selke finalist for the first time last season. Given the weird history of this award -- which honors defense but frequently for only offense-generating players -- it should come as no surprise that Cirelli's support materialized during his best offensive season (59 points in 80 games). He's ahead of that pace so far, with 11 points in 12 games, and once again is getting Selke attention.\nIt seems like Cirelli has been on deck for the Selke for a few seasons. Ditto Hischier, the Devils' outstanding two-way center. He was second for the Selke in 2022-23 and then finished fourth for the award last season. Hischier is winning over 52% of his faceoffs and getting the big defensive assignments for the Devils.\nFinally -- and once again -- it's Staal. The 20-year NHL veteran has been a Selke finalist twice but has never broken through to win the award, despite being lauded as one of the league's best shutdown centers on the Carolina checking line.\n\"He still faces top opposition, wins draws, kills penalties and as of Sunday had been on the ice for one 5-on-5 goal against,\" one voter proclaimed.\nPittsburgh Penguins star Sidney Crosby earned around 10% of the first-place votes. The highest he has placed for the Selke was fourth overall in 2018-19, but the Penguins' stunning start has given his defensive game renewed focus.\nOther players who received at least one first-place vote: Winnipeg Jets winger Kyle Connor, Colorado Avalanche forward Artturi Lehkonen, Vegas Golden Knights winger Mitch Marner, Vancouver Canucks center Elias Pettersson and Florida Panthers center Sam Reinhart, who finished second for the Selke last season.\n\"His defensive numbers are still amazing without Sasha Barkov, and he's on a 40-goal pace,\" the Reinhart voter noted. \"But then again, so is Anthony Cirelli.\"\nLady Byng Trophy (gentlemanly play)\nThis is the part where I mention that the Lady Byng Trophy for gentlemanly play should be voted on by the league's on-ice officials or by the NHL Players' Association instead of the PHWA.\nTraditionally, this award goes to a player with a top-20 point total and the lowest penalty minutes among those players.\nEntering Monday, one particular player had 19 points and zero penalty minutes in 11 games. He was third for the Byng last season. Will this finally be the season he becomes \"Gentleman\" Jack Eichel?\nJack Adams Award (best coach)\nNote: The NHL Broadcasters' Association votes on this award.\nLeader: Dan Muse, Pittsburgh Penguins\nFinalists: Joel Quenneville, Anaheim Ducks; Andre Tourigny, Utah Mammoth\nWho would have predicted that one month into the season, the Penguins team coached by a former New York Rangers assistant would have a better record than the Rangers team coached by Mike Sullivan?\nDan Muse, a longtime assistant under head coach Peter Laviolette, was hired as Sullivan's successor in June. Expectations for the Penguins entering the season were extremely tempered. Discussion centered around the potential departures of Crosby and Evgeni Malkin. The idea that Pittsburgh could return to playoff contention with this roster and a novice head coach seemed outlandish at best ... and then the Penguins got off to an 8-3-2 start, with balanced scoring and a defensive turnaround under Muse.\n\"Why is Pittsburgh even remotely relevant? What is this Muse wizardry?\" one voter asked.\n\"Tough not to go with Muse considering Pittsburgh's hot start, which probably won't last, but if he even keeps the Penguins remotely competitive this season, he'll be a lock to win this,\" another voter said.\nMuse earned an impressive 76% of the first-place votes.\nThe second choice for the panel was Quenneville. The 67-year-old coach took over the Ducks this season after he was reinstated by the NHL in July 2024. Quenneville and two other former Chicago Blackhawks executives were banned from the league in October 2021 for their mishandling of a sexual assault allegation by a former player in 2010.\nUnder Quenneville, the Ducks' play at even strength has improved greatly in both offensive output and puck possession. Anaheim was first in the Pacific at 7-3-1 after 11 games. He earned 10% of the first-place votes.\nAfter Quenneville, Tourigny earned the most support as coach of one of the season's early surprises in the Utah Mammoth. He's a great story, having coached through the chaos in the Coyotes' final three seasons in Arizona before porting over with the players to form a new team in Utah. The Mammoth have been solid offensively and defensively this season, contending in the Central.\n\"Tourigny is right behind Muse for me,\" one voter revealed.\nOther coaches receiving first-place votes were Montreal's Martin St. Louis and Detroit's Todd McLellan.\nIt's anyone's guess whether these players and coaches will still be in the awards conversation by season's end. Join us next month in this space to see how solidified these first impressions have become with the voters.", "summary": "(summarizer_error: 401 Client Error: Unauthorized for url: https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions)"}

Wearing gray sweatpants with a pink sweatshirt at UConn's practice facility, she recalls how she spent her childhood summers playing Uno and other card games at her grandparents' lake house in Minnesota. She tells me how she quickly picked up the game of Spades last summer while she was waiting in an airport lounge in China with Stephen Curry.\nFudd squints at her hand, looks up and then starts laying down cards, one after the other.\nThe 5-foot-11 guard led UConn to its 12th national championship last season and was named Most Outstanding Player of the Final Four. Since then, she wowed at New York Fashion Week, launched a podcast, took a Caribbean cruise and hobnobbed with Curry on the other side of the globe.\nShe spent the summer much as she has spent every other summer, working to perfect a game that has peaked mostly in quiet gyms in front of well-trained eyes.\nNow, after deciding the WNBA can wait, Fudd is back in Storrs, dropping cards as if they're burning her fingers. She wants all the minutes she can get during her final season in college after knee and foot injuries cut short her first three years. She wants to help UConn become the first repeat champion since the Huskies won four in a row from 2013 to 2016. \"Obviously,\" she says. She wants to get more vocal on the court and more versatile with the ball.\nMostly, she wants to show the world the Azzi Fudd that only a select few have seen. \"Hearts,\" Fudd calls out.\nBarely five minutes into our game, she lays down her final card. She smiles.\n\"Done.\"\nIN MARCH, THE weekend before the 2025 NCAA tournament started, Fudd drove out to her grandparents' house in rural Connecticut, not too far from Storrs, to meet her parents.\nShe walked into the sunroom of the \"cottage\" where her dad, Tim, was working. She told her parents she had made a decision about her future.\nAzzi had already spoken with UConn coach Geno Auriemma about her plans. He had asked her questions about her goals. What the benefits were if she left UConn for the WNBA after the season ended. What they would be if she stayed.\n\"And through all these question-and-answers that we asked, that I asked, she said, 'I'm not ready,'\" Auriemma says. \"'I haven't played enough basketball to feel confident about going there and playing at the highest level.'\"\nIn her first three seasons at UConn, Fudd played in just 42 games. She hurt a foot as a freshman and aggravated a knee as a sophomore. She tore her right ACL (for the second time) and the medial meniscus as a junior and missed all but two games. Her fourth season had been healthier. Heading into the 2025 NCAA tournament, she had played in 28 of the Huskies' 34 games, averaging 12.8 points and shooting 43.4% from 3-point range.\nShe was healthier but not necessarily happier.\n\"There was a phase where I just didn't enjoy playing,\" Fudd says. \"Which was weird, because I never really felt that way.\"\nShe didn't think she was making the right reads. Shots weren't falling. Her confidence was plummeting.\nFudd wanted to go back to Storrs to continue to hone her game and her brain, and that was the message she planned to deliver to her parents.\nTim and Katie often discuss among themselves what they see in their daughter on the court. They noticed times when she disappeared in a corner and seemed to take herself out of a game. They wondered how her recovery was progressing both mentally and physically. They were curious how their daughter felt about moving on to the WNBA versus running it back in Connecticut for one more season.\n\"We're not even having these conversations during the season,\" Tim says. \"But we're kind of allowing her to kind of figure this out. And also, we don't hear about stuff that's going on. She doesn't tell us things. She's very protective of the sanctity of what they have going on, and she keeps that separate.\"\nThrough tears, Fudd told her parents about the struggles she'd had that season, how she wasn't trusting her knee and her recovery. The wobble in December against Louisville that knocked her out for three games with a knee sprain gave her pause. She felt unsure, tentative on the court for much of the season.\n\"It was like, 'What am I even doing out here?'\" Fudd says. \"'Why even sub in?'\"\nTim had seen that version of his daughter before, back when he was on the staff at St. John's College High School in Washington, D.C. It was during her senior season, in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic. Lots of schools were closed, games were uncertain, and Azzi was still working her way back from tearing an ACL and MCL in the spring of her sophomore year.\nSt. John's traveled to Richmond, Virginia, and was in a tight game with 10 seconds left. Fudd, the No. 1 recruit in the nation, caught the ball at the top of the key. \"Her spot,\" Tim says. Instead of letting the ball fly, she passed it to a freshman who fumbled it out of bounds. St. John's lost the game.\n\"I was just like, 'What the F are you doing?'\" Tim recalls. \"'You passed the ball to a freshman? That's a shot you've made time and time again. That's unacceptable.'\"\nAfter they left the gym, Tim took Azzi's hand and asked if she was hungry. With so many restaurants closed, they went to Walmart and found some food to heat up. When they got back into the car, Tim asked Azzi if she was mad at him. Azzi told him no, that she needed the tough love.\nIn the cottage that March afternoon, she no longer needed that push from her parents. She'd arrived at the decision herself. She wasn't done with college basketball, but the uncertainty, the hiding, she was done with that.\n\"You're grateful that you go through that,\" Fudd says, \"because then you realize just how resilient or how strong you are and what you're capable of after the fact.\"\nHer parents saw the confidence grow within her during that conversation. They watched her move on in real time.\n\"The tears, they're drying up as she's talking,\" Tim says. \"'That's the old me. This is the new me.'\"\n\"'This is NCAA tournament me,'\" Katie adds.\nDuring the NCAA tournament, Fudd averaged 17.5 points and 3.0 steals, while shooting 44.4% from beyond the arc. She struggled shooting the ball during both the Sweet 16 and Elite Eight but recovered to drop 19 points in the national semifinals and 24 in the championship game. She was named the Most Outstanding Player after Connecticut's 82-59 win over South Carolina in the final.\n\"The key for this season is having the Final Four Azzi be consistently there for five months,\" Auriemma says. \"And that's the next phase in her transition from being who she was to who [and] what she wants to be in her last year here.\"\nIt was a glimpse of the player her dad knew was always there. And the player he expects to see throughout the upcoming season.\n\"At the end of the championship game, I was like, 'All of you have not seen it, none of you have seen it,'\" Tim says. \"That is Azzi Fudd.\"\nIT'S A MONTH after Fudd lifted the championship trophy in Tampa, Florida, and she is sweating and sprinting in a New York gym. Renowned skills trainer Chris Brickley, who also works with the likes of Kevin Durant, Trae Young and Paige Bueckers, is running her through one of his go-to drills.\nFudd catches the ball in the corner. As soon as the ball hits her hands, she is ready to shoot. After letting it fly, she sprints to the opposite corner for another catch-and-shoot. Then back to the other corner for a dribble pull-up. She crosses the court again for another pull-up. On her third trip to each corner, she plays live one-on-one against a defender. Then she repeats the drill around the arc. She gets three points for each 3-pointer made, two points for the pull-ups and one for scoring on the defender. Forty-two is the highest possible score. Brickley requires the NBA players he trains to score 28 points before they can move on to a different drill.\n\"It's six, seven minutes of straight running, shooting, live basketball,\" Brickley says. \"Super hard drill.\"\nThis is Fudd's third consecutive day with Brickley. They've been doing two sessions per day, and Brickley expects Fudd to start to feel the effects of the workouts. Her first time through the drill, she scores 27. Brickley runs her through it again. This time her score is a 26. Fudd does it again. She scores 27 again. On the sixth time, she breaks through for a 36.\n\"Any player that I've ever worked with at that point would be like, 'All right, today I couldn't get it,'\" Brickley says. \"That takes some mental toughness and ridiculous mindset to even push yourself through that much to get that number.\"\nThis version of Azzi Fudd is legendary in Brickley's gym and in the gym of Brandon Payne, who trains Curry and began working with Fudd after she and Cameron Brink became the first two girls to attend the SC30 Select Camp in 2018.\nFudd stood out to Payne immediately. The staff was setting up a scrimmage, and Fudd and Brink were given the option to compete against the boys. Among them were future NBA players Anthony Edwards, Jalen Suggs, Jalen Green and Cole Anthony.\n\"Azzi immediately hopped in, and not only did she hop in, but she was attacking, and she was scoring right off the bat,\" Payne says. \"I knew right then, immediately, this is somebody that's different. She was still a sophomore in high school. And she's hopping out there and competing and not only looks the part but is having great success immediately.\"\nThat was the Azzi Fudd who became the first high school sophomore to win Gatorade National Player of the Year. That was the Azzi Fudd who had full confidence in her knees. That was the Azzi Fudd who looked like she could be a multiple National Player of the Year candidate in college. That was the Azzi Fudd before the injuries gave way to doubt.\n\"Nobody trains better, nobody approaches every drill better, no one gives more than the effort that she gives you every single day,\" Auriemma says. \"So from that respect, when she's had the opportunity to, and the ability to, she's just been unbelievably good. It just hasn't carried over into games because you need a lot of game-time action. You need to play a lot in order to really play at a certain level.\"\nFudd has shown flashes. She scored 25 points on 7-of-9 shooting from 3-point range as a freshman against Tennessee. She opened her sophomore season with a stretch of games in which she hung 32 points on Texas, another 32 on NC State and then 24 points on Iowa, all of whom were ranked in the top 10. And, of course, there was the national championship game where she helped UConn break free from South Carolina with 13 first-half points and was named Final Four Most Outstanding Player.\n\"Each year there were glimpses,\" Auriemma says. \"I don't even know that she has seen the Azzi that could be for an extended period of time. I'm really hoping that this year she's able to sustain it and stay healthy and stay in that moment where she feels like she's got everything under control.\"\nFUDD WRITES AFFIRMATIONS before most games. She sits on the bus, takes out her phone and jots her thoughts on the Notes app.\nThe words remind her of her work and her talent.\n\"I can do this,\" she says. \"I'm good at this,\" she says. \"I'm going to do this,\" she says.\nLast season, she started working with a sports psychologist for the first time. She learned that the way she communicates with herself can complicate her mission. \"I found out I judge myself a lot,\" she says. \"So I've been working on noticing things and not judging, and having rational responses instead of emotional responses.\"\nInstead of focusing on something being \"wrong\" when she misses a few shots, she focuses on how she missed them. Why she missed them. Were they long? Were they short? Did she get enough lift? How can she adjust her movements to be more successful?\n\"Those kinds of things were helpful,\" she says. \"And just finding different ways to handle situations. I feel like that's been such a game changer.\"\nSometimes the confidence boosters can be external as well.\nIn August, she went to China with Curry to help run his camp and attend CurryCon. She was shocked not only by the outpouring for Curry, but also that some people knew who she was and admired her game. People camped out at the hotel gym where Curry and Fudd were staying in the hopes of seeing the NBA star. When Fudd came down one morning, fans gave her gifts and asked for her autograph.\n\"It was just this aha moment of, 'Wow, maybe I am a little popular,'\" Katie Fudd says. \"To me that's a blossoming of realizing how good she actually is.\"\nWith a microphone taped to her cheek while helping to lead camp sessions, Fudd increasingly became more comfortable in the spotlight.\n\"Sometimes, I do sit back and I'm like, 'How is my life real?'\" Fudd says. \"I am so blessed, so lucky.\"\nThose good vibes have a good shot at translating to the court, Brickley says.\n\"When she's confident, in a good space, healthy, I really don't think that there's anyone in women's basketball, period, that can shoot the ball better than she can shoot it,\" he says. \"I think she's going to finish off college on a really high note.\"\nAZZI TOLD TIM before the NCAA tournament that she wanted to celebrate a championship on a beach somewhere with a glass of champagne. There was one other thing she wanted to do this past summer, and that was go on vacation with her family. Both of her younger brothers are in college, though one is nearby in New London, Connecticut. Her parents come to every game, and her grandparents are at most home games, but it's rare that they're all able to spend time together.\n\"I couldn't tell you the last time that we all sat down and had dinner together,\" Fudd says.\nUntil their summer cruise. They had dinner together every night. They dressed up; Azzi bullied Katie out of her typical basketball shorts and T-shirts and into Azzi's own outfits.\n\"She'd be like, 'Seriously?'\" Azzi says. \"I'm like, 'We're on a cruise. No one knows you. Work it.'\"\n\"I disliked them all,\" Katie says. \"Especially the one where the top was tied on.\"\nThese are the kinds of moments Azzi cherishes that have waned during college. The cruise also was a true break before returning to her on-court and off-court commitments. She rested, recharged and tried different cocktails with dinners that detoured from her strict nutritious diet.\nOn the horizon, there's also significant uncertainty in Fudd's future. She plans to play in the WNBA next year, assuming there's a season as the players and league negotiate a new CBA. Where she will play is an open question. Caitlin Clark and Bueckers were locks at the No. 1 pick in the past two drafts, but 2026 seems much murkier. Fudd could be a lottery pick, but she could just as easily slide. ESPN's most recent mock draft projects Fudd to the Seattle Storm with the No. 3 pick as the second guard off the board, behind TCU's Olivia Miles. But the lottery cannot be held, nor can free agency happen, until the CBA gets worked out.\nAs she considers the ways her life will change with the WNBA's summer schedule, she smiles and recalls her days as a kid, when she spent parts of her summer in Minnesota visiting her grandparents. Camp Fudd was all about family, card games, the lake, tubing and time together.\n\"I'm going to miss having August in Minnesota,\" Fudd says. \"But I'm still going to try to figure it out, where I can at least make it to the cabin once because that is one of my favorite places, ever.\"\nMinnesota holds Chicago's lottery pick, which I point out. Fudd does not take the bait.\n\"Is that a jack?\" she asks, pointing to the card on the table.\nFUDD JOGS TOWARD teammate Sarah Strong as the forward dribbles toward the top of the key during UConn's exhibition game against Southern Connecticut State. It's UConn's first possession, and Fudd accepts a handoff from Strong. She immediately squares her body to the hoop and lets the shot fly from NBA range. She misses, but taking the shot signals her aggression.\nHer next opportunity comes two game minutes later. The game is tied 2-2. Fudd passes the ball to Strong at the elbow. Fudd runs to the wing to receive another handoff from Strong. Seeing her defender go under Strong rather than over the top, Fudd stays behind the 3-point line. As soon as the ball touches Fudd's hands, she explodes upward into a jump shot, holding her follow-through as the ball splashes through the net.\n\"She's like that duck swimming across the water,\" Katie says. \"It looks nice and smooth, but underneath the legs are going, but you don't see it.\"\nHer teammates noticed her newfound willingness to hunt her shot and take it with even a glimmer of space as soon as they returned to campus for fall pickup against practice players.\n\"She just came out looking very assertive and not really hesitant,\" says Strong, the 2025-26 Big East preseason player of the year. \"She knew where she wanted the ball and how she wanted to score it.\"\nStrong also was surprised by what she was hearing.\n\"Just seeing her talking more was really, really shocking,\" Strong says.\nThat's not a role Fudd ever needed to fill as a Husky. Before, she could keep her head down and lead by example. No one was expecting to hear from her when Bueckers and Nika Muhl were around.\nBut after practice one day, Fudd went to Strong's room. Auriemma had been harping on leadership in practice, and both of them knew they needed to step up, even though it didn't come naturally to either of them.\n\"We both agreed that people are probably going to look up to us,\" Strong says. \"And how we probably need to do a better job leading on the court and just getting the reps at it in practice so we can do it naturally in the games.\"\nWhen the Huskies, who open the season Tuesday against Louisville (ESPN, 5:30 p.m. ET) as the preseason No. 1, need a basket, Fudd will be called upon to take the ball and make the right read. She didn't turn into a point guard over the summer, but in critical moments, Fudd is likely to have the ball in her hands significantly more, a responsibility that had fallen on Bueckers' shoulders.\n\"I've been saying this about our guards in general, and now Azzi in particular,\" Auriemma says. \"I think they were bailed out a lot during their careers here. If they did it that night, great. If they didn't, that's OK. We would still have plenty to win with. These guys have benefited from all those other guys that have been around, and now it'll be a real growing thing for Azzi to take on that role that those other guys had.\"\nFUDD SMIRKS AS she lays down her second-to-last card.\n\"One card,\" she declares.\nFudd might be on the precipice of beating me at my family card game, but I can still make it difficult. I change the suit.\n\"You never have hearts,\" I tell her.\nFudd rolls her eyes and draws. She changes the suit to spades. After picking up a few cards, I get it to diamonds. Fudd doesn't have any of those either. Now, she's really picking up cards.\n\"There's no way,\" she says as she continues to draw. \"You're cheating.\"\nThis is the rubber match to decide the overall Dinger winner. It has been a marathon, with Fudd declaring at one point that she was \"so sick of this game.\" Really, she was annoyed she hadn't won yet.\nFudd needs to be somewhere in a few minutes. She is determined to finish. \"Go fast,\" she tells me.\nOur banter stops. The clock ticks as we lay down our cards. Diamonds. Hearts. A queen. Draw two. Spades. Clubs. A wild-card jack. The clock runs out with both of us still holding cards.\n\"That was fun,\" I say as I stuff the cards back into the box and Fudd gets up to leave.\n\"It would have been more fun,\" Fudd answers, flashing a wide smile, \"if I beat you.\"\nWardrobe styling by Sydnee Paige; Hair styling by Hayley Logan; Makeup styling by Claire Malley.

The Panthers handed the Packers their second loss of the season, and the Steelers did the same to the Colts. The former is The Big Thing topic for this week's column -- how do the Packers keep suffering these embarrassing losses? -- but there's a key nugget about the latter in the Next Ben Stats section, too.\nEvery Tuesday, I'll spin the previous week of NFL action forward, looking at what the biggest storylines mean and what comes next. We'll seek measured reactions to everyone's overreactions, celebrate the exciting stuff that nobody is appreciating and highlight what you might have missed Sunday and Monday. There will be film. There will be stats (a whole section of them). And there will be fun.\nLet's start with the Packers.\nJump to a section:\nBig Thing: Why aren't the Packers dominating?\nTrade watch: Let's play deadline bingo\nSecond Take: J.J. McCarthy hasn't turned the corner\nMailbag: Answering questions from ... you\nNext Ben Stats: Wild Week 9 stats\nMonday Night Mystery: Jones and the TBD trade\nThe Big Thing: Where is the Packers' dominance we were promised?\nEvery week, this column will kick off with one wide look at a key game, player or trend from the previous slate of NFL action. What does it mean for the rest of the season? This week, we tackle the Packers, who have been upset twice this season.\nThe Packers' loss to the Panthers on Sunday was the worst in franchise history.\nWell, not really. (Looking at you, 2014 NFC Championship Game). But by Vegas expectations, this is tied for the biggest upset loss for the Packers since the 1970 merger, as Green Bay was favored by 13.5 points against Carolina.\nThe Packers are the largest favorites to lose outright since the Titans beat the Dolphins as 14.5-point underdogs in Week 14 of the 2023 season. The Packers are the only team this season to have lost two games in which they were more than a touchdown favorite -- their Week 3 loss to the Browns as a 7.5-point favorite is the other such game.\nThe performance against the Browns somewhat made sense. The Packers were still onboarding edge rusher Micah Parsons and had just lost Jayden Reed (collarbone) indefinitely the previous week. The Browns' defense was seriously good, too: a top-five unit by every metric. Even then, it took a Jordan Love interception with under four minutes remaining, then a blocked Brandon McManus field goal, for the Packers to lose.\nSo what about the Panthers? Their offense and defense were both average entering Week 9, and Carolina walked into Green Bay missing multiple starting offensive linemen. Panthers QB Bryce Young was 2-15 as a starter on the road. Yet, the Packers trailed for nearly the entire second half, tying the score with 2:32 remaining before immediately surrendering the game-sealing field goal drive.\nThe Packers suffering two of the most disappointing losses this season is as much a story of our expectations as it is of their shortcomings. When they acquired Parsons on Aug. 28, they felt like a contender, adding a game-changing player on defense. At ESPN BET, Green Bay went from 20-1 to win the Super Bowl to 14-1 immediately after the trade, 11-1 before Week 1 and 8-1 after the team beat the Lions in the opener.\nAfter Sunday's loss, the Packers are still 9-1 to win the Super Bowl. But what was a nagging doubt after the loss to the Browns has grown into a larger one after a 40-40 tie against the Cowboys, a late-game win over the Cardinals, a quiet first half against the Steelers and Sunday's loss to the Panthers. If the Parsons trade was supposed to make the Packers into a juggernaut ... why haven't we seen that happen yet?\nTo a degree, the results against the Panthers are aberrative. The Packers had only seven drives, as Carolina wisely shortened the game with a slow offensive operation. The Panthers snapped the ball with minimal time left on a running clock (42.5 seconds of game clock per play), inched their way down the field with the rushing attack and went for it on fourth downs.\nThe best defense against a high-powered offense like the Packers' unit is keeping it on the sideline. The second-best defense? Playing deep zone coverage and forcing that offense to inch along. Carolina was in zone on 89.5% of its snaps against Green Bay.\nOf those seven Packers drives, six crossed the Panthers' 25-yard line -- yet the Packers scored only 13 points. In the past 10 years, only 11 teams have scored fewer points on at least six drives across the opponent's 25. There were many reasons for the low-scoring output: a Savion Williams fumble, a missed field goal in gusty winds, a third-and-3 TFL creating a fourth-and-8 disaster. Run this game back 100 times, and the Packers score more than 13 points in 99 iterations.\nPackers coach Matt LaFleur spoke about the Panthers' defensive approach in his postgame news conference. When asked about Love's downfield interception, LaFleur said: \"I think we all -- and I'm talking about myself as much as anybody -- when we get into these types of games where it's just about consistent execution ... you can't chase the big play. They were playing soft zone the majority of the game and making us earn and consistently move the ball, and eventually, on every drive, almost, we made a mistake.\"\nHere's the play LaFleur is referencing. This is a designed shot play: two tight ends, under center play-action, Christian Watson on the big post with Romeo Doubs behind on the over route.\n— Good Clips (@MeshSitWheel) November 3, 2025\nIt's not a great play. You can tell LaFleur is frustrated with his call -- why go for a shot play when the Panthers have been giving you free access to underneath throws? Did he get impatient, looking for a huge spark to win the game with one throw?\nThere's also a question for Love, who could have bought time to throw Doubs on the over route -- a preferable matchup, with only a linebacker sinking underneath the route -- or checked it down to the late-releasing tight end.\nSo, this was a bad play, but Love was solid at pushing the ball downfield despite the Panthers' defensive approach: 3-of-5 on throws of 20-plus yards. One incompletion was the pick, but another was a catchable ball/maybe a drop from Matthew Golden.\nThe deep ball is an inextricable part of Love's game and LaFleur's corresponding offensive philosophy. Since the 2023 season, 12.8% of Love's passes have traveled at least 20 yards downfield -- the fourth-highest rate, behind only Will Levis, Anthony Richardson Sr. and Russell Wilson. But Love and LaFleur can become overly cautious when the Packers are big favorites.\nLook at how Love's downfield aggressiveness changes relative to the expectation entering the game. Neither Love nor LaFleur is looking at Vegas spreads during the week and building a game plan around the number, of course -- but if we use the spread as a proxy for how much better we think the Packers are than their opponent, we can see that the downfield aggressiveness vanishes from the Packers' approach. Critically, this wasn't as present when Aaron Rodgers was playing under LaFleur.\nBut Love averaged 8.1 air yards per attempt Sunday -- farther downfield than we'd expect. After the game, LaFleur wished that their passing game was a little more cautious. \"We consistently moved the ball. I mean, nine-play, nine-play, 10-play, 10-play, 13-play, 12-play [drives]. I do think there's a little bit of pressing to get a big play, but when they're not there, you can't chase it.\"\nThis dichotomy is not unfamiliar. The Chiefs faced this challenge in 2021 and 2022, when opposing defenses almost universally deployed soft shell coverages against their downfield passing attack, demanding the Chiefs string together long, mistake-free drives. We spent much of last September bemoaning the explosion of two-high defenses and the accompanying deflation of the passing game.\nBut the Packers are not well-suited to the changing tide. This season, only two Packers skill position players have more than 20 yards after the catch over expectation, as calculated by NFL Next Gen Stats. One is running back Josh Jacobs. The other, unsurprisingly, is superstar tight end Tucker Kraft, who tore his ACL in this game and is out for the remainder of the season. Kraft has 109 YACOE this year; the rest of the team has 111 combined.\nLove is not used to authoring nine-play, 10-play, 12-play scoring drives. It's not how Watson, Doubs and Golden excel. That sort of offensive approach belongs to teams like the Panthers, who are trying to shorten a game as a 13.5-point underdog. To turn some of those longer drives into quicker ones that end in touchdowns, the Packers need more yards after the catch -- an element only Kraft was providing.\nA better running game would also help. Much like in YAC, the Packers are struggling relative to expectation. Jacobs has 29 rushing yards under expectation -- 12th worst among backs this season. Backup Emanuel Wilson is 16 yards below expectation; gadget WR Williams is 15 yards below expectation. The Packers are not producing the additional yards needed to play a ball-control, incremental style of offense with minimal possessions.\n\"You got to be able to run the football. I think that's been a little bit of an issue, at times,\" LaFleur said. \"If they're going to play soft shell, and you're handing the ball off and getting 2 yards -- not that it was consistently like that, but there were a couple of times like that -- you get behind the sticks, and it gets more difficult.\"\nLaFleur gets grief from the Packers' fan base for his commitment to the running game in these instances, and the numbers bear it out. The Packers are fourth in run rate over expectation against two-high shells pre-snap, but average only 4.7 yards per carry on such runs. The league average is 4.9.\nThis perspective also makes the loss against the Browns even more understandable. Love averaged 1.6 air yards per throw in that game, and Packers receivers collectively produced only 12 yards after the catch over expectation despite producing 134 YAC outright. In that game, the Browns played 47% split safety coverage -- the second-highest rate of any game in Jim Schwartz's tenure as Cleveland's defensive coordinator.\nStephen A. Smith says he isn't taking too much from the Bills' win over the Chiefs in the regular season.\nThe Packers remain an excellent team that will play a major role in the NFC -- even with the offensive injuries. There's no doubting that. But there is a friction between philosophy and execution that must be resolved between now and the postseason. Green Bay doesn't have the players or precision necessary to reliably string together long scoring drives. The Packers can do it for stretches, of course -- 20 straight completions against the Steelers! -- but haven't displayed the full-fledged dominance expected of them this season. This inconsistency is why.\nThe good news is that salvation can come from many places. If the offensive line finally gets a few healthy games together, perhaps the running game becomes more explosive. In the absence of Kraft, perhaps other YAC options such as Luke Musgrave, Golden or Williams will emerge. Reed, who has been great for YAC in previous seasons with the Packers, could return at some point this season from his collarbone and foot injuries. Love has another level to unlock in his decision-making against shell defenses; he can play faster and more aggressively. And maybe they can just avoid penalties, fumbles and missed kicks for a four-game postseason run, and that'll be that. They'll lift the Lombardi Trophy, and none will be the wiser.\nThe Packers are where other elite offenses with star quarterbacks have been before. Whether they claw their way out will be determined by the adjustments made over the next nine weeks. The NFC is still wide open. Buckle up.\nLet's play trade deadline bingo\nI made a bingo card for things that might happen on trade deadline day. Either all of us win, or all of us lose. Note that the board is live as of Tuesday, 6 a.m. ET. Check back later on Tuesday for my \"winners and losers of the deadline\" column, and I'll update on how we all did. Until that 4 p.m. ET deadline, though, let's have some fun.\nThere's nothing more disappointing than a dreary trade deadline. Let's make some deals. To build our board, I combined some of the early deadline reporting to build some squares (see: Patriots trade for a receiver), some of my internal suspicions and musings (see: Raiders are deadline dealers) and some of my favorite trade deadline traditions (see: wild overpays). If we get a mega trade of Trey Hendrickson to the 49ers, we can get 75% of the way to a bingo on one diagonal alone. If the Eagles send picks for Hendrickson, we can call them all-in and get almost the entire leftmost column.\nWe will not be counting the Eagles' deal for Jaelan Phillips for the third-round pick square, salary restructure square, or the ex-coordinator square, as it came in too early. We will, however, be counting the Dolphins sending Phillips as one of the two deals necessary for the \"two or more Dolphins trades\" square. These are the rules that I made up on the spot, and they are written in ink.\nSecond Take: Let's not make J.J. McCarthy the NFC Player of the Week this time, please\nESPN's \"First Take\" is known for, well, providing the first take on things -- the instant reactions. Second Take is not a place for instant reactions but rather where I'll let the dust settle before taking perhaps a bit of a contrarian view.\nWhat a tremendous performance from the Vikings.\nLet's start with the defense. The Lions have played 80 games (including playoffs) under coach Dan Campbell. By offensive success rate, Sunday's' 27-24 loss to the Vikings was the Lions' sixth-worst offensive performance during that tenure, with 45.5% of the Lions' drives (5 of 11) ending without Detroit picking up a first down. There has been only one game where the Lions have been worse in this category, which ironically came against the Vikings in Week 7 last season.\nBut the Vikings' defense exchanged stops for accompanying offensive explosives in that game, surrendering nine explosive passes and two big runs. On Sunday, Minnesota gave up only six explosive passes (two of which came on the Lions' final drive when they were down 10 late in the fourth quarter). They didn't give up an explosive run -- the first time the Lions were held without an explosive carry since their 2023 wild-card playoff win over the Rams.\nThis was the game the Vikings built for last offseason, as their investment at defensive tackle paid off. Free agent additions Jonathan Allen and Javon Hargrave, along with incumbents Jalen Redmond and Levi Drake Rodriguez, were highly disruptive against the Lions' tandem of new guards. The Vikings had 11 total tackles for loss -- five sacks and six more in the running game -- which is the most Campbell's offense has suffered.\nThe consistent penetration, along with the excellent blitz designs of defensive coordinator Brian Flores, had Jared Goff frazzled in the pocket. Goff's difficulties creating throws from moving platforms were on harsh display, as he completed only 40% of his pass attempts for 4.7 yards per throw when pressured while suffering the five sacks. When unpressured: 86.4% completion rate for 9.7 yards per attempt.\nMinnesota sent tons of pressure down the center of the line, forcing RB Jahmyr Gibbs into pass protection -- but stopping power against charging linebackers is certainly not his game. As Nate Tice of Yahoo pointed out, Gibbs gave up more pressures than any running back in a game since 2018.\nThe Lions have serious questions on offense (they had equally bad games by success rate against the Browns and Buccaneers this season) -- but last season, they had the Vikings' number in explosive passing plays. This was a dramatic improvement for Flores' group and a clear product of an offseason intention to get better against this divisional foe.\nBefore we move on, a quick word for special teams: By NFL Next Gen Stats' numbers, the Vikings got plus-27% win probability added by special teams against Detroit. That's 20th among 268 team performances this season -- a truly elite effort. Returner Myles Price, who has been great this season, had a 61-yard kickoff return in the first quarter to set up the Vikings' first scoring drive. Minnesota also blocked a fourth-quarter field goal attempt that would have drawn the Lions within four points, and returned that ball to the Detroit 26 to set up a crucial final field goal that provided the eventual margin of victory. Big plays!\nThis brings us to the Vikings' offense, which was good enough to win Sunday. The running game was the driving force of the outing. The Vikings' rushing success rate of 54.2% was the 12th-best game an offense has had against Detroit in the Campbell era. By EPA per rush, 11th. By explosive rush rate, 14th.\nVikings coach Kevin O'Connell clearly wanted to slow down the pass rush of the recently extended Aidan Hutchinson, often having running backs run right at him or freezing him in place with backfield motion and option plays. Minnesota was far trickier in the running game with McCarthy at the helm than they've been in previous seasons with Kirk Cousins, Sam Darnold or Carson Wentz. They tagged runs with RPOs and included McCarthy as a keep option on zone-read looks.\n— Good Clips (@MeshSitWheel) November 4, 2025\nHopefully, we call the Vikings' enormous victory in Detroit exactly what it was: a team win. Every phase contributed positively, which insulated McCarthy from having too big an impact on the outcome. It was only his third career start. He was coming back from a major injury, playing in a hostile environment, and at a confidence low point, given his two-game sample size and some of the negative coverage about his injury.\nBut team wins become quarterback wins with shocking ease when McCarthy is the quarterback. The broadcast, as seemingly every Vikings broadcast does, recalled McCarthy's winning record as a high school and college quarterback. Heck, he's 2-1 as an NFL starter -- a winning record.\nMcCarthy's best plays came in high-leverage moments. His best throw was the third-and-5 dot to Jalen Nailor to seal the win. McCarthy makes the right read against man coverage, taking the wheel route to Nailor over the dig to Jefferson, who is running right into a robber safety. The ball is out on time and thrown accurately, with the correct pace so Nailor can track it.\n— Good Clips (@MeshSitWheel) November 3, 2025\nMcCarthy had several accurate throws and is at his best just ripping fastballs into the sideline. But as was the case in September, throws with touch challenged his ball placement, and poor pocket footwork sapped his consistency. McCarthy remains fearful of windows in the middle of the field, which led to a couple of his sacks and limited the sort of concepts O'Connell could call: 6% of McCarthy's attempts have been to the intermediate middle of the field this season, less than half of Darnold's rate (13.4%) in 2024.\nThough the middle of the field is not McCarthy's strength, he brings other tools to the table. His mobility was a positive against the Lions' blitz-happy approach, and his third-and-8 scramble touchdown was a good reminder of the added benefit he brings with his legs. But on the day, the Vikings' passing game -- and offense as a whole -- was again erratic under McCarthy.\nConsider the split in offensive performance on called runs relative to dropbacks, and the offensive engine was clear.\nAltogether, Minnesota's offensive success rate was 40.8%, in the same neighborhood as the win against the Bears (41.8%) and loss to the Falcons (38.0%). The Vikings averaged only 4.4 yards per offensive play, and five Lions defensive penalties for 41 yards and four first downs really helped Minnesota move the ball.\nWhenever the numbers look bad for McCarthy, there's a protesting refrain: \"He's clutch! He's poised! He just wins!\" McCarthy looked calm and controlled on the first two drives, which were scripted plays -- but once the offense got off script and the Lions hit him a few times, his composure started to wane. He was sacked five times, turned the wrong direction during a couple of run plays, dropped a snap and sprayed several throws. In the second half, the Vikings' two scoring drives started on the Lions' 26- and 35-yard lines, respectively.\nJudging McCarthy's year so far has been one of the season's great challenges. The prime-time win against the Bears and accompanying mythmaking felt like strenuous overreaching. While the Vikings were uber cautious rushing McCarthy back, the shadow-benching conspiracy after the ankle injury felt similarly preposterous. Once again, this was McCarthy's third career start. Though early returns are highly worrisome, we're 10 starts from establishing a firm opinion on the young passer, and another 17 after that from writing that opinion in pen, not pencil.\nThis is a game to cast aside our quarterback obsession and see the forest for the trees. I ranked the Vikings' coaching staff the best in football this offseason, and this game is a tremendous example. Flores and O'Connell outcoached their counterparts on the Detroit sidelines in highly adverse circumstances. To make McCarthy the story of this game is to totally erase the spectacular efforts of many Vikings -- coaches and players. I simply won't have it.\nFrom y'all\nThe best part of writing this column is hearing from all of you. Hit me on X (@BenjaminSolak) or by email (benjamin.solak@espn.com) anytime -- but especially on Monday each week -- to ask a question and potentially get it answered here.\nFrom Horse: As someone who was against starting Daniel Jones and has had to stand up and eat crow as DJ has been impressively not-awful to begin the year, how loud should I sound the alarm after he looked completely out of his element in Pittsburgh?\nNot loudly. The Colts had six turnovers Sunday. Sometimes, you just have six turnovers and lose a football game. That's the annoying and wonderful thing about the sport. Anyone can implode at any time.\nThere are clear areas in which Jones might regress (and has started to regress; see below). But the collective quality play of the Colts' skill positions, as well as tremendous coaching from Shane Steichen, won't all evaporate at once. The Colts probably won't end the season as the greatest offense in NFL history -- their pace through eight games -- but they'll still be pretty good.\nThat defense, though? Help is needed.\nField Yates breaks down why Jordan Love isn't a lock to start in fantasy this week.\nFrom John: What's the team you feel like has the best chance to improve on one side of the field with better health and more experience in the second half?\nThe Buccaneers' offense is definitely up there. Mike Evans isn't coming back, but Jalen McMillan, Bucky Irving and Emeka Egbuka all will. Right tackle Luke Goedeke, whom I call the most underrated player in football, was just designated to return from IR, as well. Tristan Wirfs got back in the starting lineup but hasn't looked like his dominant self -- hopefully, he'll round into form as the season progresses. Tampa's underlying offensive metrics are not good, but they've done well to survive the first half of the season at 6-2. I expect an offensive leap down the back nine.\nOther good candidates: Ravens defense (already seeing that start to come to fruition). Panthers offense (with a little offensive line stability, some actual secondary pass-catching options in Jalen Coker and Xavier Legette, and a healthy Bryce Young ... we might see them in the NFC playoff picture). 49ers offense (duh).\nFrom Collector: You can pick any player to be your WR #1 for the rest of the year. Your only goal is to win a Super Bowl this year. Contract doesn't matter for this exercise, and you're guaranteed that whoever you pick will remain healthy. How many receivers are you picking before JSN?\nOof. OOF. This is brutally hard. By rule, I am extremely suspicious of single-season production. I want a player to be elite for multiple years before I call them elite -- though you could argue Jaxon Smith-Njigba's elite play began late last season. And his play isn't just elite -- it's so uniquely spectacular that it almost breaks all the rules.\nOK, OK. I will take Ja'Marr Chase, Puka Nacua, and Justin Jefferson over Smith-Njigba. They've been elite for longer. Smith-Njigba has been better than each of those players this season, but still, a larger sample matters -- and Nacua does stuff as a blocker that Smith-Njigba doesn't. Same with Chase after the catch.\nI think...that's it? Not A.J. Brown, not Amon-Ra St. Brown, not Nico Collins, not Drake London -- though, oh my heavens, did you see London against the Patriots? Ridiculous player. Strongest hands in football.\nCeeDee Lamb is close -- I think if he hadn't gotten hurt, he'd be shredding this season. Then again, he wouldn't have 4.58 yards per route run, which is what Smith-Ngjiba is at right now. It's the best eight-game start to a season for yards per route run in NFL history ... 2023 Tyreek Hill is second at 4.45 yards per route run, and the only player above 4.00 since routes run were charted in 2008.\nYeah, that's it. Just those three. I can't put him above Jefferson. I just can't.\n(I really want to, though.)\nDomonique Foxworth, Rex Ryan and Adam Schefter debate if the Colts' level of concern after getting beat by the Steelers.\nNext Ben Stats\nNFL Next Gen Stats are unique and insightful nuggets of data that are gleaned from tracking chips and massive databases. Next Ben Stats are usually numbers I made up. Both are below.\n44.1%: That was Patrick Mahomes' completion percentage against the Bills on Sunday, the worst mark of his career (142 games).\nThe story of this achievement was pressure. Mahomes went 3-of-16 on pressured dropbacks in this game for a paltry 18.8% completion rate. In the renewed spirit of a downfield passing attack, which the Chiefs spent all offseason promising and promoting, Mahomes averaged 17.9 air yards per attempt on pressured dropbacks -- the second-highest mark for a game in his career.\nIt's tough to fault Mahomes' approach too much -- there were open receivers downfield and blanketed receivers underneath. But one thing is glaring, and must be addressed before a potential Buffalo rematch in the postseason -- 18 pressured dropbacks, but zero scrambles.\nplus-60: That's the Broncos' point differential in the fourth quarter this season. The next-closest teams are at plus-37 (Panthers, Jets).\nThrough the first nine games of a season, plus-60 is the fifth-best fourth-quarter point differential this century. The 2025 Broncos are behind the 2015 Texans, 2009 Saints, and weirdly enough, two more Broncos seasons: 2012 and 2016. That 2009 Saints team is of particular note, as Sean Payton was the coach there, as well. The Saints started the season 9-0 and finished 13-3 on the way to winning the Super Bowl.\nI'm suspicious of the 2025 Broncos' ability to repeat that run, and it comes down to the other three quarters. The 2009 Saints were plus-60 in point differential across the first three quarters; the 2025 Broncos are minus-1. Though Payton is finding offensive solutions in the fourth quarter to alleviate early-game woes, this is one of those classic short-sample success stats that we expect to regress to the mean as time goes on.\nminus-0.81: That's Daniel Jones' EPA per dropback when pressured over the past two weeks -- the second-worst mark among all quarterbacks. From Weeks 1-7, it was 0.15 -- the best.\nAgainst the Steelers specifically, Jones averaged minus-1.03 EPA per dropback -- a disastrous day. He was pressured on only 32% of his dropbacks, but went 6-of-13 with two interceptions and five sacks. Left tackle Bernhard Raimann and right tackle Braden Smith struggled with the Steelers' collective speed at edge rusher. They gave up 10 quick pressures (a pressure in under 2.5 seconds), the most Jones had endured this season.\nWe know play under pressure is highly volatile. The worst plays, like sacks, always come from pressure; often the best plays, like big downfield completions, come because a blitz was picked up. Jones was unsustainably excellent against pressure to start the season, but he likely won't have minus-1 EPA per pressured dropback the rest of the way, either.\nSomething we expect to be sticky in the NFL is pressure-to-sack ratio -- the rate at which quarterbacks turn pressures into sacks. Some quarterbacks are low-sack players because they have such tremendous escapability (Josh Allen) or throw the football away readily (Bo Nix). Others are high-sack players because they hold the ball to create (Drake Maye) or struggle to identify pressure quickly enough (Justin Fields).\nIn his six seasons before this year, Jones had a sack-to-pressure rate of 23.27%, which was a little above league average. From Weeks 1-7 this season, Jones was at 8.57% -- a fraction of his previous career pace. Over the past two weeks? 30.8%. Right back up again.\nThe game against the Steelers does not erase Jones' excellent play to begin the season, but it serves as a reminder of what we've learned about quarterbacks like Goff, Darnold and Jalen Hurts in recent years. On supercharged offenses with quality running games, elite skill position teammates and excellent scheming, the weak point is often the quarterback -- even when that quarterback's stats look sterling. If and when the Colts' offense breaks this season, expect the breaking point to be Jones ... until he proves otherwise.\n52%: That was the Bills' run rate in their win over the Chiefs. In the previous six games against the Chiefs, their run rate was 38%.\nRunning the ball to control the clock against Kansas City is far from a new idea. But the Bills have never been so committed to a quality, downhill running game authored by true handoffs, not Allen scrambles or keepers. Running back James Cook III had 114 yards on 27 carries -- the first 100-yard rusher against the Chiefs' defense since his former college teammate Zamir White did it in Week 16 of 2023.\nBut the story isn't Cook. It's this offensive line. Cook had 55 yards before contact -- the most of any back with at least 10 carries against the Chiefs since the 2020 season -- and was touched behind the line of scrimmage on only 18.5% of his carries. And it's not just the offensive line: fullback Reggie Gilliam played 17 snaps and was dominant at the point of attack. Tyrell Shavers, the Bills' best blocking receiver, played a season-high 31 snaps, too.\nThe Bills have the league MVP at quarterback, but their handoff game -- again, without needing to use Allen's legs -- is simply one of the five best in the NFL this season. Buffalo needs to continue leaning into a downhill, run-first approach on offense and unleash Allen only when opposing defenses have been forced to index to the run.\n100%: How certain I was that Brandon Aubrey would hit that 68-yard field goal attempt Monday.\nThat was Aubrey's first miss from 60-plus yards this season. (He had hit from 61 and 64 yards previously.) It was not just his first career miss from 60-plus yards in AT&T Stadium -- it was his first miss from 50-plus in AT&T Stadium. He was 18-of-18 before that kick. There is nobody in the world happier that Aubrey finally missed a distance kick than Jaguars PK Cam Little, who set the record with a 68-yarder at the end of the first half against the Raiders. The history books will still remember Little -- at least for another week.\nMonday Night Mystery: Jerry Jones and the TBD Trade\nEditor's note: The Cowboys traded for Bengals linebacker Logan Wilson on Tuesday morning after this story posted.\nHere's what we know.\nAt roughly 2 p.m. ET on Monday, Cowboys owner and general manager Jerry Jones appeared on the \"Stephen A. Smith Show\" on Sirius XM Radio and announced that the Cowboys ... had made a trade? Were working on making a trade? Multiple trades?\nYeah. We don't know much.\n\"A lot of action going on right now in terms of trading,\" Jones said before the Cowboys played Monday night. \"We certainly have made a trade, and we may make a couple more trades before that deadline. We've made one. We possibly could make two more, and I'm going to wait and let you read about that when we send the papers in tomorrow.\"\nIt's unclear if the \"one\" Jones is referring to is the Micah Parsons trade, which technically was before this year's trade deadline. Or another one that hasn't been processed yet. And if the one is yet to come, does the \"two more\" bring us up to three total? Just how active will the Cowboys be?\nJones' postgame comments were predictably unhelpful. When asked if he still had a trade ready for tomorrow, Jones responded, \"We still can, yes.\" Presumably, there is an offer on the table that the Cowboys can still accept, and Jones plans to accept. When asked if the trade was contingent on the result Monday, Jones continued: \"Again, again, understand what I've said: absolutely we do. We'll see how tomorrow goes. Today was all about tomorrow. You shouldn't do anything. You should wait and see what we do tomorrow.\"\nI don't know what that means.\nLet's go back to what we do know. The Cowboys are 3-5-1 after an embarrassing home loss to the now 3-5 Cardinals. Dallas' offense had only three points before the fourth quarter, in which the Cowboys trailed by 17 points and were benefiting from garbage-time defense. Jacoby Brissett, the Cardinals' backup quarterback, had his best passer rating (115.1) of the season and his fifth-best mark of the past four seasons.\nI'll never say never with Jones, the man who traded Parsons because he was upset a handshake deal from months previous fell through. But it's hard to imagine trades that can fix this defense, which needs multiple players at linebacker and cornerback to have a viable pass defense, and could use (get this) another run-stuffing defensive lineman to boot. Nobody can turn over a roster like that midseason.\nThe offense had a quiet game against Arizona until the late touchdown, but that's still a playoff unit. This defense is prohibitive to 2025 contention, and the Cowboys would be brazenly short-sighted to make significant acquisitions at the deadline in the hopes of saving this season.\nSo, what is Jones up to this time? We'll find out together!", "summary": "(summarizer_error: 401 Client Error: Unauthorized for url: https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions)"}

There have been 14 walk-off field goals this season, which is the most through nine weeks since the 1970 AFL/NFL merger, per ESPN Research. Meanwhile, after the Colts' loss to the Steelers, both the NFC and the AFC have at least three teams tied for the conference's best record in Week 9 or later for the first time since 2002.\nHow do all of these teams fit in our updated Power Rankings? We restacked the NFL heading into Week 10, which includes byes for four teams (Bengals, Chiefs, Cowboys and Titans). In addition to the 1-32 rankings, our NFL Nation reporters picked the most important game remaining for each team. This could be a rivalry game, a matchup with playoff implications or one that might affect the team's draft standing.\nLet's get into it with No. 1, which shifted again from the previous week. Our power panel of more than 80 writers, editors and TV personalities evaluated how NFL teams stack up against one another, ranking them from 1 to 32.\nJump to a team:\nARI | ATL | BAL | BUF | CAR | CHI | CIN\nCLE | DAL | DEN | DET | GB | HOU | IND\nJAX | KC | LAC | LAR | LV | MIA | MIN\nNE | NO | NYG | NYJ | PHI | PIT | SF\nSEA | TB | TEN | WSH\n1. Buffalo Bills (6-2)\nWeek 9 result: Beat the Chiefs 28-21\nWeek 9 ranking: 4\nMost important game remaining: Week 15 at the Patriots\nThe Bills are trying to win a sixth straight AFC East title, but they have significant competition to reach that goal. After the Patriots took the first meeting, this matchup could end up being huge as the Bills look to secure at least one more postseason game in their last year at Highmark Stadium. Winning the division is always emphasized by Buffalo coach Sean McDermott as the first step to reaching the Super Bowl, and this game could prove pivotal. -- Alaina Getzenberg\n2. Philadelphia Eagles (6-2)\nWeek 9 result: Bye\nWeek 9 ranking: 3\nMost important game remaining: Week 10 at the Packers\nThere's an argument to be made for each of their upcoming three games: at the Packers, home against the Lions then at the Cowboys, who represent the Eagles' biggest (and maybe only) threat in the NFC East. But the Eagles' plans go well beyond a divisional crown. They are involved in a tight race for the NFC's No. 1 seed and can gain the upper hand against one of their top competitors at Lambeau Field. Philadelphia should get a boost from new defensive acquisitions Jaelan Phillips, Jaire Alexander and Michael Carter II as well as the potential return of edge rusher Nolan Smith Jr. (triceps). A win over Green Bay could help propel Philly through a challenging closing stretch, as the Eagles have the eighth-most difficult remaining schedule, per ESPN's Football Power Index (FPI). -- Tim McManus\n3. Indianapolis Colts (7-2)\nWeek 9 result: Lost to the Steelers 27-20\nWeek 9 ranking: 1\nMost important game remaining: Week 10 vs. the Falcons in Berlin\nAfter the way the Colts played Sunday, with six turnovers and the offensive line getting uncharacteristically pushed around, the question around Indianapolis will be how they bounce back. This was just their second loss this season, but it was the first that raised questions about what kind of team they are. Likewise, quarterback Daniel Jones will have a lot to prove. His three interceptions versus the Steelers are likely to give fuel to the narrative that he hasn't fully turned the page on his Giants era. -- Stephen Holder\n4. Tampa Bay Buccaneers (6-2)\nWeek 9 result: Bye\nWeek 9 ranking: 5\nMost important game remaining: Week 16 at the Panthers\nWe don't know how the Buccaneers will respond to being without wide receiver Mike Evans (broken collarbone) for an extended period. We also don't know when Bucky Irving, Chris Godwin Jr., Luke Goedeke or Jalen McMillan will return. But we do know that four out of their final five games are against divisional opponents, which do count toward tiebreakers. The Bucs have made a huge point of emphasis on avoiding the midseason slumps they've experienced the past two seasons. But should they need a late-season surge, that road game against Carolina is smack dab in the middle of it. -- Jenna Laine\n5. Los Angeles Rams (6-2)\nWeek 9 result: Beat the Saints 34-10\nWeek 9 ranking: 8\nMost important game remaining: Week 10 at the 49ers\nThe Rams have six wins, but their Week 9 victory was surprisingly their first over an NFC opponent. Los Angeles has played only one divisional game: a Week 5 loss at home to San Francisco that ended with a turnover on downs in overtime. In what has been a tight NFC West race so far, not losing the head-to-head tiebreaker to the 49ers could be important for a Rams team with aspirations for a deep playoff run. -- Sarah Barshop\n6. Detroit Lions (5-3)\nWeek 9 result: Lost to the Vikings 27-24\nWeek 9 ranking: 2\nMost important game remaining: Week 11 at the Eagles\nThe Lions will get tested by an elite squad in a showdown with the reigning Super Bowl champions on \"Sunday Night Football.\" They will need to bring their A-game to win in Philadelphia, and it'll serve as a good barometer for where the Lions stand among the league's elite teams after already losing to Green Bay and Kansas City on the road. Detroit is looking to secure its third straight NFC North crown. -- Eric Woodyard\nField Yates reacts to Jahmyr Gibbs' disappointing fantasy output vs. the Vikings.\n7. Denver Broncos (7-2)\nWeek 9 result: Beat the Texans 18-15\nWeek 9 ranking: 9\nMost important game remaining: Week 17 at the Chiefs\nYes, the Broncos have their first meeting against the Chiefs in Week 11 as well as a Week 15 matchup with the Packers and the regular-season finale versus the Chargers (after Los Angeles beat Denver in Week 3). But the Christmas night tilt at Kansas City could have a lot on the table. Perhaps most notably -- beyond any playoff seeding implications -- is that a victory at Arrowhead Stadium could mean the Broncos are truly over their eight seasons of struggles following Peyton Manning's retirement. The Chiefs have won every AFC West title since the Broncos last claimed the divisional crown in 2015, and Denver hasn't triumphed at Arrowhead since Sept. 17, 2015. -- Jeff Legwold\n8. New England Patriots (7-2)\nWeek 9 result: Beat the Falcons 24-23\nWeek 9 ranking: 10\nMost important game remaining: Week 15 vs. the Bills\nThe Patriots already beat Buffalo in Week 5, and sweeping the season series would give them the edge in a potential tiebreaker in the AFC East standings. The Bills have won the past five division titles. On the day New England coach Mike Vrabel was hired in January, he said the team's goals are to win the division, host home playoff games and compete for championships. -- Mike Reiss\n9. Seattle Seahawks (6-2)\nWeek 9 result: Beat the Commanders 38-14\nWeek 9 ranking: 11\nMost important game remaining: Week 16 vs. the Rams\nFor the sake of picking one game, we'll go with the late-season, prime-time matchup against the team currently tied with Seattle atop the NFC West standings. But you could go with either of the Seahawks' two games against Los Angeles (the first meeting will be in Week 11) or their regular-season finale at San Francisco. According to the FPI, the 49ers -- despite all their injuries -- have almost the same chance to win the division (35%) as the Rams (37%), so Seattle (28%) might very well be in a three-team race the rest of the way. -- Brady Henderson\nField Yates and Daniel Dopp break down Rome Odunze’s zero-point fantasy performance.\n10. Kansas City Chiefs (5-4)\nWeek 9 result: Lost to the Bills 28-21\nWeek 9 ranking: 6\nMost important game remaining: Week 11 at the Broncos\nFollowing their bye week, the Chiefs will face the current AFC West leader. The easiest way for the Chiefs to regain command in the division is to sweep the Broncos. Kansas City coach Andy Reid, quarterback Patrick Mahomes and the rest of the team should have plenty of motivation too. In the 2024 regular-season finale, the Broncos, needing a win to clinch the conference's final playoff spot, beat Kansas City 38-0. One could argue the Chiefs, who already had clinched the top seed and rested their starters, didn't enjoy Broncos coach Sean Payton running up the score. -- Nate Taylor\n11. Green Bay Packers (5-2-1)\nWeek 9 result: Lost to the Panthers 16-13\nWeek 9 ranking: 7\nMost important game remaining: Week 12 vs. the Vikings\nWe could've picked any of the remaining NFC North games because the Packers still have five of them left in a hotly contested division. The Vikings game marks the beginning of three straight divisional games, so let's go with that one. The Packers have won their only NFC North matchup so far, beating the Lions way back in Week 1. Last season, Green Bay went just 1-5 in the division; right now, the Pack are clinging to a half-game lead in the standings. -- Rob Demovsky\n12. Pittsburgh Steelers (5-3)\nWeek 9 result: Beat the Colts 27-20\nWeek 9 ranking: 13\nMost important game remaining: Week 14 at the Ravens\nThough the Steelers continue to lead the division, every AFC North game is important. At the top of that list is their first meeting with Baltimore. With quarterback Lamar Jackson back from a hamstring injury, the Ravens are poised to make a run in the division, and Pittsburgh needs to keep them at bay. It lost both games in Baltimore a season ago, including a 28-14 playoff defeat in which running back Derrick Henry ran all over the Steelers' defense. -- Brooke Pryor\n13. Los Angeles Chargers (6-3)\nWeek 9 result: Beat the Titans 27-20\nWeek 9 ranking: 14\nMost important game remaining: Week 15 at the Chiefs\nIt's been 12 years since the Chargers swept the Chiefs. In one of the league's most competitive divisions, this game could mean the difference in a playoff spot. But beyond that, sweeping the proverbial big brother of the AFC West would give the Chargers more confidence as they look to contend for the franchise's first Super Bowl title. In their opening game of the season, the Bolts beat the Chiefs in Brazil, which Harbaugh called \"monumental.\" -- Kris Rhim\n14. San Francisco 49ers (6-3)\nWeek 9 result: Beat the Giants 34-24\nWeek 9 ranking: 12\nMost important game remaining: Week 10 vs. the Rams\nThe 49ers are 3-0 in the NFC West, and wins over the Rams and the Seahawks have given San Francisco a leg up in what figures to be a hotly contested divisional race. The Niners pulled off an upset over Los Angeles in Week 5, and if they can do it again this week, it would put them in prime position to make another run at the division crown and return to the postseason after a one-year hiatus. -- Nick Wagoner\n15. Jacksonville Jaguars (5-3)\nWeek 9 result: Beat the Raiders 30-29 (OT)\nWeek 9 ranking: 15\nMost important game remaining: Week 10 at the Texans\nThe Jaguars could bury the Texans in the division with a victory in Houston. That would give Jacksonville a four-game lead -- including the tiebreaker -- over the Texans and essentially make the AFC South a two-team race with Indianapolis. The Jaguars still have two games remaining against the Colts (7-2) and the Titans (1-8). -- Mike DiRocco\n16. Carolina Panthers (5-4)\nWeek 9 result: Beat the Packers 16-13\nWeek 9 ranking: 19\nMost important game remaining: Week 16 vs. the Buccaneers\nYou also could argue for the Week 18 matchup with Tampa Bay, but if the Panthers lose to the same opponent two weeks earlier, then the regular-season finale could be irrelevant. Why these games matter is simple: It could come down to winning one or both for the Panthers to claim the NFC South crown. There are other key contests in between -- versus the 49ers, the Rams and the Seahawks -- but winning against the current division leader will be most important. -- David Newton\n17. Chicago Bears (5-3)\nWeek 9 result: Beat the Bengals 47-42\nWeek 9 ranking: 16\nMost important game remaining: Week 11 at the Vikings\nThe Bears' next chance at a division win is in two weeks. Chicago started the season in an 0-2 hole in the NFC North with a three-point defeat to the visiting Vikings and a blowout loss in Detroit. Gaining ground in the division before the Bears face Green Bay twice and Detroit to end the season is critical if they want to make the playoffs. While they are tied for second place with Detroit and a half-game behind first-place Green Bay, a win at Minneapolis' U.S. Bank Stadium would go a long way before three more NFC North games. -- Courtney Cronin\nRex Ryan questions why the Commanders didn't pull Jayden Daniels before he got injured.\n18. Minnesota Vikings (4-4)\nWeek 9 result: Beat the Lions 27-24\nWeek 9 ranking: 21\nMost important game remaining: Week 10 vs. the Ravens\nIt might sound cliché, but the Vikings' most important game is their next one, no matter the opponent. Sunday's upset did nothing but bring their record to .500. They remain at the bottom of the NFC North, arguably the league's toughest division, and are two games behind the Packers in the loss column. Assuming that the Packers, the Lions and the Bears continue playing well, the Vikings can't afford to fall any further behind if they want to push toward a playoff berth. All three division foes are direct competitors for a playoff spot. -- Kevin Seifert\n19. Baltimore Ravens (3-5)\nWeek 9 result: Beat the Dolphins 28-6\nWeek 9 ranking: 22\nMost important game remaining: Week 18 at the Steelers\nIt looks like a two-team race in the AFC North. According to the FPI, the Steelers have a 48% chance to win the division, while the Ravens have a 47% chance. If it ends up being decided in the regular-season finale, Baltimore will have to overcome its struggles in Pittsburgh to win its third straight division title. The Ravens have lost four of their past five games in Pittsburgh, averaging just 15.0 points per outing. -- Jamison Hensley\n20. Houston Texans (3-5)\nWeek 9 result: Lost to the Broncos 18-15\nWeek 9 ranking: 17\nMost important game remaining: Week 10 vs. the Jaguars\nIf the Texans lose this next game, they'd be staring at a 3-6 record. It also would mean being swept by a divisional opponent, which would hurt the Texans in potential tiebreaker scenarios and put them in a position to have to run the table for any chance at the playoffs. They presently have a 10% chance to make the postseason, per the FPI, while the Jaguars have a 55% chance. -- DJ Bien-Aime\n21. Dallas Cowboys (3-5-1)\nWeek 9 result: Lost to the Cardinals 27-17\nWeek 9 ranking: 18\nMost important game remaining: Week 12 at the Eagles\nThe Cowboys can't begin to think about the playoffs until they win consecutive games. But the best way to make the postseason would likely be winning the NFC East -- and that would require help. The Eagles play the Packers and Lions in the next two weeks. Let's say they lose both. At 3-5-1, the Cowboys are in must-win territory, starting Nov. 17 at the Raiders, which would set up the rematch of the season opener at AT&T Stadium with the Eagles. Even that might not be enough because the Chiefs, Lions, Vikings and Chargers await the Cowboys, so there is no easy path. -- Todd Archer\n22. Arizona Cardinals (3-5)\nWeek 9 result: Beat the Cowboys 27-17\nWeek 9 ranking: 24\nMost important game remaining: Week 10 at the Seahawks\nIt's the most important one because it's the next one -- and no, that's not coachspeak. While the Cardinals got a win Monday to break a five-game losing streak, they need more -- badly. Sunday's outing will be the Cards' next opportunity to get back in the race, but given how good Seattle looked at Washington, they will have their work cut out for them. This Arizona team, which was in first place in the NFC West last November and thought it would be even better this season, is still in a tough spot. -- Josh Weinfuss\n23. Cincinnati Bengals (3-6)\nWeek 9 result: Lost to the Bears 47-42\nWeek 9 ranking: 23\nMost important game remaining: Week 11 vs. the Steelers\nIt always felt like the Bengals' rematch against the Steelers was going to be crucial for Cincinnati's playoff hopes. But after back-to-back losses heading into the bye, the outcome against Pittsburgh also could determine if the Bengals should fully commit to reevaluating and rebuilding the roster. According to the FPI, they have a 6% chance of making the playoffs. -- Ben Baby\n24. Washington Commanders (3-6)\nWeek 9 result: Lost to the Seahawks 38-14\nWeek 9 ranking: 20\nMost important game remaining: Week 11 vs. the Dolphins in Madrid\nThe Commanders have lost four in a row, but three of those were to teams over .500 and the past two came against Kansas City and Seattle. They will host Detroit on Sunday, and it could get ugly since they're just not equipped to beat good teams right now. But if the Commanders lose to 2-7 Miami -- and look bad again on defense -- it will signal a massive issue. Washington coach Dan Quinn said he isn't making changes on his defensive staff, but a rough game in Spain would not bolster anyone's confidence in this group to improve the situation. -- John Keim\nDaniel Dopp breaks down Jaxson Dart’s consistent fantasy performance.\n25. Atlanta Falcons (3-5)\nWeek 9 result: Lost to the Patriots 24-23\nWeek 9 ranking: 26\nMost important game remaining: Week 15 vs. the Buccaneers\nThe Falcons have lost three straight and are third in the NFC South. So, any playoff discussion has to be put on the backburner for the moment. Atlanta does have the light part of its schedule -- with games against the Panthers, the Saints and the Jets -- coming over the next month. If the Falcons can take care of business in those contests, then the \"Thursday Night Football\" matchup with Tampa Bay will have serious divisional implications. Right now, though, Atlanta badly needs to string some wins together before a once-promising season goes down the drain. -- Marc Raimondi\n26. New York Giants (2-7)\nWeek 9 result: Lost to the 49ers 34-24\nWeek 9 ranking: 28\nMost important game remaining: Week 17 vs. the Cowboys\nTeam co-owner John Mara regularly says he wants to walk off the field after the final game feeling good about the direction of the team. Well, a Week 17 win at home over the rival Cowboys could leave a positive taste in his mouth, especially if rookie quarterback Jaxson Dart finishes strong. Eli Manning and the Giants have long talked about how the final game of his rookie year in 2004 (a come-from-behind win over Dallas) gave him and the team confidence going into the following season. In 2005, they had an 11-5 record and made the playoffs. -- Jordan Raanan\n27. Miami Dolphins (2-7)\nWeek 9 result: Lost to the Ravens 28-6\nWeek 9 ranking: 25\nMost important game remaining: Week 10 vs. the Bills\nThe Dolphins' season is effectively over in terms of playoff consideration, and there's no single contest that could change the course of their fate -- except this Sunday's home game against Buffalo. Their previous matchup with the Bills came down to the wire, and sneaking out with a win would have a positive effect on a locker room that might look a lot different after Tuesday's trade deadline. Miami has a string of winnable games coming after this week, with the Commanders, the Saints and the Jets next up on the schedule. Beating the Bills would be one heck of a springboard. -- Marcel Louis-Jacques\n28. Las Vegas Raiders (2-6)\nWeek 9 result: Lost to the Jaguars 30-29 (OT)\nWeek 9 ranking: 29\nMost important game remaining: Week 11 at the Cowboys\nThe Raiders' schedule doesn't offer too many opportunities for them to go on a winning streak. That's why their matchup against Dallas will be crucial. Las Vegas' offense is trending in the right direction with the return of tight end Brock Bowers from a knee injury. And since the Cowboys have one of league's worst defenses (31st in yards allowed at 404.6 per game), the Raiders could pull off an upset. Las Vegas will play Dallas and Cleveland in back-to-back weeks, but the schedule gets tougher after that. The Raiders' final six games feature matchups against the Broncos, the Chargers, the Chiefs and the Eagles. -- Ryan McFadden\n29. Cleveland Browns (2-6)\nWeek 9 result: Bye\nWeek 9 ranking: 27\nMost important game remaining: Week 10 at the Jets\nThe Browns have multiple games remaining against teams that will be vying for the No. 1 pick, and the one-win Jets appear to be among those who will be in the quarterback market this offseason. The FPI currently gives the Browns an 19.1% chance -- the third-best odds in the NFL -- of getting the top pick in the 2026 draft, while the Jets sit at fourth with a 13.7% chance. A victory could come at the cost of potentially missing out on an elite QB prospect months from now. -- Daniel Oyefusi\n30. New Orleans Saints (1-8)\nWeek 9 result: Lost to the Rams 34-10\nWeek 9 ranking: 30\nMost important game remaining: Week 17 at the Titans\nThe Saints will play both the Jets and the Titans at the end of the season, and all three teams are still searching for their second win. If things continue on the same path for the Saints and the Titans, then this game has the potential to determine who will be picking at the top of the draft in 2026. Currently, New Orleans is just behind Tennessee with a 29.4% chance at the No. 1 pick, per the FPI. -- Katherine Terrell\n31. New York Jets (1-7)\nWeek 9 result: Bye\nWeek 9 ranking: 31\nMost important game remaining: Week 16 at the Saints\nThis could have major implications for the No. 1 pick in the 2026 draft, as the Jets, the Saints and the Titans are the league's only one-win teams. Unlike the Titans, who drafted Cam Ward last year, the Jets and the Saints figure to be in the QB market. The Jets have Justin Fields under contract next season, but he has yet to demonstrate he can be their long-term answer. His Total QBR is 37.9, which ranks 30th out of 32 qualified passers. -- Rich Cimini\n32. Tennessee Titans (1-8)\nWeek 9 result: Lost to the Chargers 27-20\nWeek 9 ranking: 32\nMost important game remaining: Week 18 at the Jaguars\nHaving their final game against AFC South rival Jacksonville gives the Titans an opportunity to end on a high note and build upon that next season. This campaign was meant to be a building block for future success. The Titans' brass knew the team wasn't likely to be competitive. At this point, given Tennessee's struggles and a new staff probably coming this offseason, the players have nothing to play for other than their pride and putting good film out for evaluators. Getting the chance to play spoilers if the Jaguars are in playoff contention would add motivation. -- Turron Davenport", "summary": "(summarizer_error: 401 Client Error: Unauthorized for url: https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions)"}

From position battles to injuries and so much more, the news cycle will constantly affect player values in fantasy football.\nOur Fantasy Football Buzz file, with contributions from our ESPN fantasy writers and our NFL Nation reporters, aims to provide fantasy managers with the intel they need as news breaks around the league.\nKey links: Fantasy depth charts | Weekly rankings\nScoring leaders | Projections | Strength of schedule\nSeattle Seahawks trade for WR Rashid Shaheed\nBy Tristan H. Cockcroft\nShaheed's arrival in Seattle could be interpreted as a statement on Cooper Kupp's health (and, frankly, his performance). Shaheed is the No. 26 wide receiver in scoring thus far, and that is despite dealing with the fourth-worst quarterbacking situation in the league going by passer rating. Both players run a majority of their routes out of the slot, and in those situations, Shaheed has been the superior performer this season, averaging 0.43 fantasy points per route run with a 76% catch rate compared to Kupp's 0.40 and 72%. Shaheed also has familiarity with offensive coordinator Klint Kubiak, for whom the receiver averaged 13.3 fantasy points over the first six weeks of 2024 before suffering a season-ending knee injury.\nSomething's got to give, and if it means shuffling either receiver to the outside at the expense of Week 9 breakthrough performer Tory Horton's routes, that's not necessarily a good thing. The Seahawks simply don't throw frequently enough to feed this many mouths, with their 50.3% rate of passing plays ranking second lowest in the league, whereas the Saints' 61.3% was fourth most. Shaheed was also showing good rapport with rookie quarterback Tyler Shough in the weeks leading up to the trade, meaning there's more downside for the players affected by this trade than fantasy managers want to see.\nThis isn't to declare Shaheed an immediate cut, but his usage should be closely monitored in the next couple of games to see how the team's receiving pecking order shakes out. In all likelihood, Shaheed will be a matchups-oriented WR3 in Seattle and a stronger choice in games Kupp misses outright. Back in New Orleans, unsurprisingly, Shough has his work cut out for him, especially if there are further trades of their skill position players. He'll likely need to lean more heavily upon tight ends Juwan Johnson and Taysom Hill.\nA final, relevant benefit for Shaheed: By being traded specifically between these two teams, he escapes what would've been an upcoming bye to join a team that has already had its week off, meaning he could be a rare 18-game player.\nWR Jakobi Meyers traded to the Jacksonville Jaguars\nBy Eric Moody\nThe Las Vegas Raiders sent Meyers to Jacksonville for 2026 fourth- and sixth-round picks, finally granting his trade request before the deadline. A pending free agent, Meyers made it clear he wanted out, and the Jaguars were willing to take on his remaining $5.25 million salary.\nIn Jacksonville, Meyers will fill the slot role vacated by Travis Hunter (IR, knee) and could see steady volume while Brian Thomas Jr. deals with an ankle injury. Like in Las Vegas, he'll still face target competition, but Trevor Lawrence and the team's up-tempo offense could boost his consistency in fantasy leagues.\nMeyers is one of just three players in the league with 30-plus receptions and zero receiving touchdowns this season, along with Kendrick Bourne and Dalton Schultz. Through seven games, he has 33 receptions for 352 yards on 49 targets. Expect a small fantasy bump in Jacksonville, while Tre Tucker (rostered in 39.7% of ESPN leagues) and Brock Bowers headline the Raiders' receiving options moving forward.\nColts, Cowboys and Jets' trades have fantasy-relevant impact on defense\nBy Tristan H. Cockcroft\nTrade deadline moves don't only shuffle things up at the skill positions. Swaps including significant defensive names can influence both our team D/ST, as well as future matchups, analysis.\nIn the Indianapolis Colts' case, their trade for cornerback Sauce Gardner potentially improves them dramatically on defense, adding him to what was an already improving secondary since fellow cornerback Kenny Moore II returned from an Achilles' issue in Week 6. For the season, the Colts had allowed the eighth-most fantasy points per game to wide receivers, and fourth-most when adjusting for the schedule, but those rankings are certain to shift closer to the center, if not into \"suboptimal matchup\" territory with their new personnel. Moore, after all, has been one of the best cornerbacks in coverage when healthy, and while Gardner's 2025 numbers have disappointed, he was Pro Football Focus' top-graded cornerback as recently as 2023.\nThis is no longer a slam-dunk matchup to target with opposing wide receivers, which is relevant when evaluating players like Nico Collins, Brian Thomas Jr., Rashid Shaheed and Jauan Jennings from Weeks 13-17. That said, the Colts' D/ST is a difficult sell, being that they face the third-toughest schedule the rest of the way.\nThe Dallas Cowboys' additions of defensive tackle Quinnen Williams (from the New York Jets), and linebacker Logan Wilson (Cincinnati Bengals), does boost the league's worst run defense, but likely only bumps the team from the fourth-best schedule adjusted matchup to merely top-10. That said, the team's secondary is still extremely problematic, meaning this should still be one of the top defenses to exploit with quarterbacks and wide receivers, and perhaps even more so now. The Cowboys, the third-worst defense in fantasy scoring thus far, aren't likely to offer many useful D/ST games, other than perhaps Week 11's matchup against the Las Vegas Raiders.\nAs for the Jets, who dealt away Gardner and Williams, upgrade them as a matchup to exploit with your skill-position players. Though the Jets are the eighth-toughest schedule adjusted wide receiver matchup for the season, despite Gardner's so-so performance to date, it's unlikely that the installation of either Azareye'h Thomas or Quan'tez Stiggers into their starting lineup will afford them the chance to maintain that lofty ranking.\nJacoby Brissett and Marvin Harrison Jr. shine, Dak Prescott struggles and Arizona RBs confound on \"Monday Night Football\"\nJacoby Brissett looked sharp against a vulnerable Cowboys secondary, finishing with 24.8 fantasy points while filling in for Kyler Murray. The Cardinals have averaged 25.7 points and 357 total yards per game in Brissett's starts compared to 18.8 points and 288.4 yards with Murray. Brissett has also averaged 256 passing yards per game compared to Murray's 170, and the Cards have converted 56% of their third downs with Brissett under center compared to 40% with Murray. Head coach Jonathan Gannon insists the starting job remains Murray's once healthy, but Brissett's steady production, with 19 or more fantasy points in each of his three starts, makes that stance harder to defend each week.\nMarvin Harrison Jr. led the Cardinals with 10 targets and posted a season-high 22.6 fantasy points in one of the best performances of his young career against a Cowboys defense that has been shredded by opposing wide receivers all season. This is an encouraging sign for his rest-of-season outlook, as Arizona has the 13th-easiest remaining schedule for fantasy receivers.\nEmari Demercado led the Cardinals' backfield with 15 touches and 8.8 fantasy points, compared to Bam Knight's 11 touches and 6.7 points. Demercado found success on the ground, finishing with 79 rushing yards, his second-best total of the season. Trey Benson is eligible to return in Week 10, and none of the Cardinals' running backs have performed well enough in his absence to threaten his workload. Once Benson returns, Demercado, Knight and Michael Carter can all be dropped.\nDak Prescott struggled, finishing with just 15.4 fantasy points against the Cardinals after managing only 6.6 against the Broncos in Week 8, a far cry from the 26.2 points per game he averaged from Weeks 4 through 7. Prescott had major issues under pressure, completing only 5 of 12 passes with an interception and taking five sacks. He was pressured on 19 dropbacks Monday night, the second most for him in the past three seasons, and both the pressures and sacks were season highs for the Cardinals' defense.\nRyan Flournoy further solidified his role as the Cowboys' No. 3 receiver behind CeeDee Lamb and George Pickens. Although he had just two targets and most of his 9.2 fantasy points came on his TD catch, Flournoy played more snaps and ran more routes than KaVontae Turpin and Jalen Tolbert combined.\nPlayers injured in Sunday's games (Updated)\nBy Stephania Bell\nJayden Daniels, QB, Washington Commanders (left elbow): Late in Sunday night's game against the Seahawks, Daniels appeared to get his left arm caught behind him as he was being tackled, and the forces going through his elbow from the ground and his and the defender's weight resulted in a dislocation. His left elbow was placed in an immobilizer brace, and Daniels was escorted off the field with the medical staff. Early reports indicated no fracture, and as of now, Daniels is out indefinitely.\nFor more details on the injury and how the Commanders will move forward, check out this piece: Jayden Daniels injury FAQ: Dislocated elbow info, recovery time\nPuka Nacua, WR, Rams (chest): Nacua exited Sunday's game halfway through the third quarter with what was described as a chest injury after going to the ground hard on top of the football. Although he didn't return to the game, he remained on the sideline and appeared to be in good spirits. McVay later said Nacua \"got his ribs\" and said he could have potentially returned to the game but the team opted to err on the side of caution. He was also scheduled for follow-up imaging Monday, but the Rams remained hopeful that Nacua might not miss time with the injury.\nTucker Kraft, TE, Packers (right knee): The Packers' initial fears of a torn ACL for their star tight end were confirmed on Monday after Kraft underwent an MRI. An unfortunate roll up on Kraft's right knee while he was blocking for Josh Jacobs appears to have been the culprit, and the season comes to an early conclusion. Once Kraft undergoes surgery to reconstruct the ACL, he is looking at an average recovery window of nine to 12 months.\nC.J. Stroud, QB, Texans (concussion): As he slid to the ground while appearing to give himself up on a scramble in the second quarter of Sunday's game, Stroud was hit by a defender and his head slammed backwards to the turf. Stroud was removed from the game for a concussion evaluation and did not return. He was feeling better Monday according to coach Demeco Ryans, but he remains in the concussion protocol and his status for Week 10 is uncertain.\nAaron Jones Sr., RB, Vikings (right shoulder): Jones exited Sunday's game in the third quarter and did not return. He was ruled out with a right shoulder injury, reported to be an AC sprain by the NFL Network. Coach Kevin O'Connell told reporters Monday that Jones was sore but that further testing resulted in \"positive news early on\" and the hopes are he will be able to practice at some point this week.\nBrian Thomas Jr., WR, Jaguars (ankle): Thomas injured his ankle late in the game's regulation time against the Raiders and did not play in overtime. He had come into Week 9 still recovering from a shoulder ailment sustained in Week 7 and was limited in practice early in the week but was off the game status report heading into Sunday. The shoulder did not appear to be a factor in Sunday's game, but the addition of an ankle issue isn't ideal. With teammate Travis Hunter going on injured reserve late last week, Thomas's status will be important to monitor as the week progresses.\nMatthew Golden, WR, Packers (shoulder): Golden exited the game in the third quarter with what was reported to be a shoulder injury. Coach Matt LaFleur told reporters Monday that Golden's injury was not a long-term issue and that the receiver would be day-to-day. The Week 10 game for the Panthers is Monday night, giving Golden an extra day to get healthy ... but unfortunately it also means the team's first official injury report isn't due until Thursday.\nLuke McCaffrey, WR, Commanders (collarbone): McCaffrey looked to be in a good deal of pain while being evaluated on the sideline after getting injured on the opening kickoff return. It didn't take long for the team to rule him out for the rest of the game, hinting at a more significant injury. After undergoing further testing Monday, McCaffrey was reported to have a fractured collarbone (clavicle) and is expected to be placed on injured reserve shortly, according to ESPN's John Keim. Typically it takes an additional six to 10 weeks following surgery to get medical clearance for football, depending on the combination of treatment (surgical vs non-surgical) and healing.\nSunday Notebook: Who got the ball?\nTristan H. Cockcroft weighs in on Caleb Williams' Week 9 performance and says he hasn't proven himself as a consistent starting fantasy quarterback.\nby Eric Moody\nSharing selected notes from Sunday's games on which players were used and in what situations. I use these notes to inform my rankings and other fantasy football decision-making.\nRunning Backs\nWith Rhamondre Stevenson sidelined by a toe injury, rookie TreVeyon Henderson started for the Patriots and handled most early-down and passing snaps against the Falcons. He finished with 18 touches and 12.7 fantasy points. Terrell Jennings rotated in for short-yardage work and scored a 3-yard touchdown, while D'Ernest Johnson saw limited action after being elevated from the practice squad. Henderson was the more valuable back due to his receiving role, but his workload could shrink if Stevenson returns or the Patriots add another running back before the trade deadline\nSamaje Perine exited early with an ankle injury against the Bears and didn't return. Before that, he was set for an expanded role after finishing with 10 touches and 17 fantasy points last week. His absence forced Chase Brown into an every-down role, and he finished with 19 touches and 19.2 fantasy points, eerily similar to his usage late last season. If Perine misses time, Brown could be a top-10 fantasy RB moving forward. Rookie Tahj Brooks played only three snaps and remains a depth option.\nRJ Harvey led the Broncos in receptions (5) and receiving yards (57), but Troy Franklin paced the team in targets (10). Harvey played 31% of the offensive snaps compared to J.K. Dobbins, who played 46% and led the team with 61 rushing yards on 15 attempts. Harvey's workload has been limited, but he's made the most of it, scoring 16 or more fantasy points in back-to-back games thanks to his touchdowns.\nAshton Jeanty set a new career high in offensive snaps coming out of the Raiders' bye week, finishing with 18 touches and 19.9 fantasy points.\nTony Pollard played more snaps than Tyjae Spears, which typically happens when the Titans are in a neutral game script. Pollard finished with 11 touches and 7.8 fantasy points, while Spears had 10 touches and 9.2 points. Spears has recorded three or more receptions in four straight games, but it's hard to trust either back in lineups given how poor the Titans' offense has been this season.\nWoody Marks led the Texans backfield in snaps played, routes run, and targets (3), but Nick Chubb led the way with 11 rushing attempts and 3.4 fantasy points compared to Marks' 10 carries and 2.7 points. It's a frustrating situation for fantasy managers, as Houston continues to use both backs in a committee.\nTight end Taysom Hill led the Saints in rushing with four carries for 30 yards, while Alvin Kamara struggled with a season-low seven touches and 0.7 fantasy points. Rookie Devin Neal continues to cut into Kamara's workload following Kendre Miller's placement on injured reserve. Despite the decline, Kamara should remain rostered, as the Saints have one of the easiest remaining schedules for fantasy running backs.\nThe Seahawks' backfield continues to operate as a committee between Kenneth Walker III and Zach Charbonnet. Walker played 56.8% of the offensive snaps, while Charbonnet logged 35%. Walker finished with 13 touches for 8.1 fantasy points, and Charbonnet had nine touches for 5.6.\nJacory Croskey-Merritt led the Commanders' backfield in snaps played, routes run, and touches (13) but finished with just 5.1 fantasy points while Chris Rodriguez Jr. had 12 touches for 12.5 points, thanks to a rushing touchdown. That said, the bulk of Rodriguez's touches came late in the game after Washington pulled its starters due to the deficit.\nKareem Hunt operated as the Chiefs' lead back against the Bills with Isiah Pacheco ruled out, playing over 70% of the offensive snaps and finishing with 12 touches for 12.5 fantasy points, highlighted by a rushing touchdown. Brashard Smith played just 20% of the snaps and logged three carries.\nReceivers\nEric Karabell explains why Tee Higgins is a top-20 fantasy wide receiver after his nice game vs. the Bears.\nThe Jaguars' receiver room was decimated by injuries, positioning Parker Washington to lead the group in snaps played, routes run, targets (9) and fantasy points (17). With Travis Hunter on injured reserve and both Brian Thomas Jr. and Dyami Brown leaving late with injuries, Washington stepped up. Even if the starters return, he's set for an expanded role after operating as Jacksonville's primary slot receiver in an Jaguars offense that relied heavily on three-receiver sets against the Raiders.\nRomeo Doubs led all Packers skill players in snaps played, routes run, targets (10) and receiving yards (91). He finished with 16.1 fantasy points, his second-highest total of the season. With Tucker Kraft out for the year, Jordan Love could lean on him even more moving forward.\nAlec Pierce finished with a season high 13 targets and 17.5 fantasy points against the Steelers. He has had 10 or more targets in two of his past three games, scoring 14.8 and 17.5 fantasy points.\nKeenan Allen finished with just five targets and a season-low 6.1 fantasy points against the Titans. The Chargers once again leaned heavily on single-receiver sets, with Tre' Harris logging more snaps (though he was targeted only twice) than Allen for the second straight week because of those formations.\nRashid Shaheed finished with five receptions for 68 yards against the Rams, playing over 80% of the offensive snaps for the first time since Week 1. He emerged as rookie quarterback Tyler Shough's go-to receiver. Shaheed's nine targets led the team, while Chris Olave and Juwan Johnson each had four. His role could continue to grow as his chemistry with Shough develops.\nTre Tucker led the Raiders receivers in snaps played and routes, but it was Jakobi Meyers who led the way with six targets while Tucker had four. Tyler Lockett who was signed last Monday surpassed the Raiders' rookies in snaps played and routes run against the Jaguars. This shouldn't be surprising, as the veteran wide receiver reunited with his former coach and quarterback.\nWide receivers Rashee Rice and Xavier Worthy played over 80% of the Chiefs' offensive snaps for the second consecutive game. Both ran a similar number of routes against the Bills and each finished with seven targets against the Bills, but it was Rice who had the more productive fantasy outing with 18.6 points, boosted by a receiving touchdown.\nThe Chiefs had no answers for the Bills' tight ends, as Josh Allen threw for a career-high 149 yards when targeting Dalton Kincaid, Dawson Knox, and Jackson Hawes. Kincaid finished with six targets and a season-high 22.1 fantasy points. He led the tight end trio in routes run but not in snaps played, something to be mindful of if you plan to start him in lineups.\nMore from Sunday: Week 9 fantasy winners and losers\nEarly Sunday fallout: Dowdle takes control of Panthers' backfield, Loveland saves Bears\nLiz Loza reacts to Colston Loveland's big fantasy performance in the Bears' win over the Bengals.\nBy Liz Loza\nC.J. Stroud exits early\nStroud left Week 9's contest versus the Denver Broncos after attempting just 10 passes in the first half. He was later ruled out with a concussion for the remainder of the outing. Davis Mills took over under center, falling to the Broncos in a closely heated tilt. Despite the QB substitution, Nico Collins posted solid numbers, converting seven of 11 looks for 75 receiving yards and 14.5 fantasy points. The Houston Texans host the Jacksonville Jaguars in Week 10.\nJustin Jefferson hobbled in second half\nJefferson appeared to be shaken up on a play in the second half. After reportedly taking a few shots of pickle juice, however, the issue appeared to be cramps. The star wideout returned to the contest. He finished the day leading the team in looks, hauling in six of nine balls for 47 receiving yards and a score (16.7 fantasy points). With J.J. McCarthy looking capable, Jefferson's fantasy stock remains, mercifully, intact.\nDevin Singletary splits touches with Tyrone Tracy Jr.\nWith Cam Skattebo out of the lineup, Tracy was expected to handle the bulk of the backfield's duties. Instead, he was out-carried by Devin Singletary by a margin of three totes. Not surprisingly, Tracy was more active as a receiver, converting three of four targets. Tracy finished the day with 37 scrimmage yards while \"Motor\" managed 51 total yards. The New York Giants backfield is shaping up to be a headache of an RBBC moving forward.\nColston Loveland takes advantage of thin roster\nThe Loveland breakout appears imminent. With Luther Burden III sidelined and Cole Kmet and DJ Moore in and out of the lineup, the rookie tight end emerged as a reliable option for Caleb Williams. Loveland saved the day for the Chicago Bears, making good on six of seven looks for 118 receiving yards and two heroic touchdowns (29.8 fantasy points) in a wild win over the Cincinnati Bengals. The matchup should stiffen versus the Giants in Week 10. However, it will be hard to put this genie back in the bottle. Expect Loveland to remain on the starting/streaming radar.\nLooking ahead\nMatt Bowen labels Rico Dowdle an RB2 going forward based off his Week 9 performance.\nRico Dowdle thrives as the engine of Carolina's offense\nDave Canales toyed with a split backfield after Chuba Hubbard returned to action two weeks ago. That phase appears to have passed, however, as Dowdle dominated the RB touches in Week 9. The former Cowboy pushed the Carolina Panthers offense forward, touching the ball a decisive 27 times for 141 scrimmage yards and helping Carolina pull off a stunning upset at Lambeau Field. The effort earned him (and his virtual investors) 28 fantasy points. Dowdle is a must-start option versus the New Orleans Saints in Week 10.", "summary": "(summarizer_error: 401 Client Error: Unauthorized for url: https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions)"}

Jayden Daniels, one of the top quarterbacks in the sport, suffered a significant elbow injury late Sunday night, and earlier in the day, Tucker Kraft, the tight end scoring leader this season, tore a ligament in his knee.\nEach Monday, before the current NFL weekend ends, we will identify players available in at least 50% of ESPN standard leagues worthy of your attention, from standard formats to deeper options. The NFL is a weekly league, and player valuation and roles seldom remain stagnant. It does not matter how you acquire players for your fantasy rosters, just that you acquire them!\nQuarterback\nTristan H. Cockcroft breaks down why Joe Flacco makes a solid flex quarterback for fantasy managers.\nJ.J. McCarthy, Minnesota Vikings (25.3% rostered in ESPN leagues): McCarthy (ankle) returned from a six-week (five games) absence and delivered 18.92 points in the surprising win over the Detroit Lions. McCarthy completed only 14 passes, but two went for touchdowns, and he turned a 9-yard run into his second rushing touchdown in three games. McCarthy remains a bit raw as a passer, and perhaps the Vikings don't want him throwing the ball more than 25 times per game, but if he keeps running for touchdowns, fantasy managers must pay attention. McCarthy faces the (perhaps) revitalized Baltimore Ravens defense in Week 10.\nMarcus Mariota, Washington Commanders (5.2%): Mariota has been here before, and with Daniels (elbow) sidelined for perhaps the rest of this lost Washington season, he will start his fourth game on Sunday against the Lions. Mariota cannot run like Daniels (few can), but he does have 122 rushing yards and a touchdown in brief duty this season, so he isn't the typical backup QB. The Commanders have yet to serve their bye (Week 11) -- and that must be a factor for fantasy managers -- but they also have games with the Miami Dolphins, New York Giants and Dallas Cowboys looming.\nMichael Penix Jr., Atlanta Falcons (14.2%): Penix (knee) returned from missing one game to fire off three touchdown passes to Drake London in a 1-point loss to the New England Patriots. The final tally was 22.74 points, which is the most for Penix since Week 1 (24.02 points). The Falcons play the Indianapolis Colts this week. It will be hard to recommend Penix, but the schedule after that is occasionally intriguing, with two games against the New Orleans Saints and one against the New York Jets.\nDeep-league options/streamers/random thoughts\nThe San Francisco 49ers claim that starting QB Brock Purdy (58.9%) could return from his toe injury for Week 10 against the Los Angeles Rams, and he may be available in your league(s). Backup Mac Jones (6.1%), who scored 15.8 points Sunday against the New York Giants, has played capably. Whoever starts at QB for the 49ers appears worth relying on.\nCincinnati Bengals hero Joe Flacco (32.9%) scored 30.8 points in Sunday's late loss to the Chicago Bears, his third consecutive week among the top quarterback producers in the league. Alas, he won't do this in Week 10, as the Bengals are on their bye. Perhaps you want to stash Flacco anyway, in anticipation of future weeks. The Bengals still have two remaining matchups with the Ravens.\nLas Vegas Raiders starter Geno Smith scored 26.26 points in the overtime loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars. You should not add Smith for Week 10 against the Denver Broncos, but the defenseless Cowboys loom for Week 11.\nHouston Texans starter C.J. Stroud (56.8%) left Sunday's game with a concussion, and we might not know his status for Week 10 against the Jaguars until later in the week. Veteran Davis Mills (0.0%) didn't exactly shine in relief of Stroud, and the Texans lost to the tough Broncos, but for those in superflex and deep formats, every starting QB for a given week indeed matters.\nRunning back\nFiled Yates and Daniel Dopp discuss Tyrone Tracy Jr. and Devin Singletary's disappointing fantasy week.\nIsaiah Davis, Jets (9.1%): The Jets come off their bye week and play the Browns in what surely will be anything but an offensive slugfest in Week 10. Still, we recall Davis, the backup to Breece Hall, scoring 17.9 points against the defenseless Bengals in Week 8. Perhaps it was a mirage, but Davis boasts skills, and even if Hall remains a Jet and healthy, Davis has value.\nDevin Singletary, Giants (4.5%): Giants RB Tyrone Tracy Jr. (86.3%) was featured in this spot last week and became the most added player entering Week 9, albeit with the unfortunate caveat that perhaps he isn't really going to help fantasy managers all that much with Cam Skattebo out for the season. On Sunday at home against the San Francisco 49ers, Tracy did not help much. He turned eight touches into 37 yards and 6.7 points. Singletary was not much better, turning 10 touches into 51 yards and 7.1 points. Perhaps neither Giants back can help anyone in Week 10 against the Bears or beyond, but Singletary is the one available in myriad leagues, and there just isn't much to add at running back.\nDeep-league options/streamers/random thoughts\nFantasy managers got excited about Patriots rookie TreVeyon Henderson (82%) against the Atlanta Falcons because starting RB Rhamondre Stevenson (toe) was slated to miss Week 9. Henderson turned 18 touches into 87 yards and a season-best 12.7 points, but second-year option Terrell Jennings (10.6%) scored the team's rushing touchdown on a 3-yard scamper in the second quarter. Henderson's frustrated managers do not want any timeshare, but Jennings is bigger and thus may be the \"touchdown guy.\" Or not. Who knows? Jennings isn't worth an add in standard leagues yet, but things could change.\nSeveral other rookies made quite the impact Sunday, including Bears seventh-round pick Kyle Monangai (66.7%) and Broncos second-round choice RJ Harvey (67.6%). Monangai scored 22.8 points in the wild win over the Bengals, while Harvey contributed 16.6 points in the close win over the Texans. They exceed our 50% threshold but perhaps they are available in your league(s). Go get 'em, because while both are likely to share touches, they are really good.\nWide receiver\nMatt Bowen explains why fantasy managers should be more inclined to consider Alec Pierce after his Week 9 performance.\nChristian Watson, Green Bay Packers (25.6%): Watson has seen precisely four targets in each of his two games after returning from a torn ACL in Week 8, but opportunity may be opening up with Kraft's serious injury and rookie WR Matthew Golden (shoulder) leaving Sunday's loss as well. Watson, now in his fourth season, has been a fantasy underachiever/disappointment much of that time, and QB Jordan Love remains reckless and inconsistent, but someone other than Josh Jacobs and Romeo Doubs must catch the football.\nAlec Pierce, Colts (11.8%): The Colts scuffled in Sunday's loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers, but QB Daniel Jones threw 50 times (24 passes in the fourth quarter!) and each of the team's top three wide receivers excelled. Pierce was the most targeted option, with one more look than Michael Pittman Jr., and he registered season bests of six catches for 115 yards. In addition, Josh Downs (58.6%) caught a touchdown pass. The Colts do not want Jones throwing 50 times in any game, but Pittman is nearly universally rostered, Downs is popular and Pierce is somewhat forgotten. That seems odd. Pierce averaged 22.3 yards per reception last season, and he's at 20.9 YPR this season.\nParker Washington, Jacksonville Jaguars (5.1%): This team's passing game remains rather dysfunctional, and losing Heisman Trophy winner Travis Hunter (knee) isn't going to help, but Washington stepped up Sunday with team highs of eight receptions, nine targets and 90 receiving yards in the overtime win over the Raiders. Star Brian Thomas Jr., one of the bigger disappointments in fantasy, injured his ankle late in the win and could miss time. The Jaguars face a tough Texans defense in Week 10, but Washington could see enough volume to matter anyway.\nDeep-league options/streamers/random thoughts\nSeattle Seahawks rookie Tory Horton (7.3%) enjoyed his Sunday night in Washington with a pair of touchdown grabs, giving him five on the season, albeit on only 13 receptions. That level of success with so little volume tends to be unsustainable, but as long as veteran Cooper Kupp (hamstring) remains out and QB Sam Darnold remains outstanding, Horton may matter in deep leagues.\nBears journeyman Olamide Zaccheaus (1.2%) led the offense with eight targets against the Bengals, turning six catches into 58 yards, a touchdown and a season-best 17.8 points. Zaccheaus caught seven passes in Week 8 against the Baltimore Ravens, and now we can ask if he is becoming a legitimate factor in the offense. After all, DJ Moore hasn't caught as many as six passes in any game this season. Rome Odunze, September superstar, was shut out on three targets Sunday. It is premature to call Zaccheaus, with his fourth franchise over the past four seasons, a safe pickup, but we are trending in that direction.\nWan'Dale Robinson (81.1%) is the Giants WR rostered in the most leagues, which is fair. Darius Slayton (14.9%) cannot match Robinson for season production, but if Flacco can generate more than 40 points against the Bears, perhaps Giants rookie Jaxson Dart can as well. Slayton earned a season-best seven targets on Sunday, generating his first double-digit PPR outing of the season.\nTight end\nColston Loveland, Bears (23.6%): The No. 10 pick in the NFL draft from Michigan was our featured tight end in this space last week, but oddly enough, he is rostered in fewer leagues today. The number must rise this week after Loveland scored a position-high 29.8 points in the wild win over the Bengals, which included his game-winning touchdown in the closing seconds. (Start your tight ends against the Bengals!) In addition, the Bears lost TE Cole Kmet (concussion) during the game. Loveland should continue earning more targets in Week 10 against the Giants.\nHarold Fannin Jr., Cleveland Browns (50.6%): The rookie scored 18.4 points in Week 8 against the Patriots, then hit the bye week. Now, he is back! Same goes for Jets rookie Mason Taylor (14.7%). The Browns feel less dysfunctional than the Jets (which is saying something), so go with Fannin first.\nTheo Johnson, Giants (33.2%): We've also mentioned this fellow in this space, and Johnson continues to be a goal-line presence for the rookie Dart. He scored his fifth touchdown in Sunday's loss to the 49ers. Again, the Giants play the Bears this coming week. Johnson should be a factor.\nDeep-league options/streamers/random thoughts\nThe Texans do not possess the most efficient offense, but TE Dalton Schultz (20.7%), despite nary a touchdown reception this season, has three double-figure fantasy outings in his past four games, and backup QB Mills certainly looked his way Sunday. Schultz sees consistent targets, though not in the red zone, and he may be an upgrade for your squad.\nWith Kraft carted off Lambeau Field on Sunday and facing a long rehab from an ACL tear, backup Luke Musgrave (0.2%) should emerge as a steady contributor for deeper formats. Musgrave cannot perform at Kraft's level, but he enjoyed three receptions (season high) in the fourth quarter of Sunday's stunning loss to the Carolina Panthers. We should expect more catches in Week 10 against the Philadelphia Eagles.\nBye weeks: To Drop or Not to Drop?\nThree of the league's more proficient offenses are serving the Week 10 bye (Kansas City Chiefs, Bengals, Cowboys), as well as the worst offense (Tennessee Titans). Three obvious Chiefs must be kept rostered (Mahomes, Rashee Rice, Travis Kelce), and fantasy managers should keep RB Isiah Pacheco (knee) around, too. He is expected to play in Week 11. Moving on from overrated WR Xavier Worthy (93.8%) is OK. He hasn't scored more than 11.1 points since Week 4, even before Rice made his season debut.\nWith the Cowboys and Bengals, keep the starting RBs (Javonte Williams, Chase Brown), WRs (CeeDee Lamb, George Pickens, Ja'Marr Chase, Tee Higgins) and Dallas QB Dak Prescott and TE Jake Ferguson. Bengals QB Joe Burrow (61%) is likely in an IR spot for most managers. It may or may not make sense to keep Flacco rostered. Finally, the only Titans player that should remain rostered is RB Tony Pollard, though he is barely a flex option (if that) these days. WR Calvin Ridley (60.7%) presumably would be more valuable if traded to another team.\nDefense\nThe Buffalo Bills D/ST (36.5%) has reached double-digit points in only two games, but the schedule is attractive for fantasy managers most of the rest of the way. The Bills play the Dolphins in Week 10, then later face the Texans, Steelers, Browns and Jets.\nThe Ravens D/ST (42.4%) scored 12 points in shutting down the Dolphins in Week 9. Next up are road games against the Vikings and Browns, then a home game with the Jets. Perhaps it is not too late for the Ravens D/ST -- popular on draft day but clearly a bust to this point -- to aid fantasy managers.\nDo not expect myriad points scored when the Browns D/ST (29.6%) and Jets D/ST (9%) face off in Week 10, and same goes for the much-anticipated (OK, not really) Panthers D/ST (4.4%)-Saints D/ST (1.5%) matchup. However, the Panthers shut down the Packers in Week 9 and, as with the Jets, will face a rookie QB. Go with the Panthers as a reasonable streamer.", "summary": "(summarizer_error: 401 Client Error: Unauthorized for url: https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions)"}

Courtois made another stunning stop to keep out Virgil van Dijk early in the second half; however, the Belgium international was finally beaten when Mac Allister nodded home Szoboszlai's free kick in the 61st minute.\nMuch of the buildup to the game had been dominated by talk of Trent Alexander-Arnold's return to Anfield, and the defender was jeered when he was introduced from the bench in the 78th minute. Kylian Mbappé came closest for the visitors in the second half, with his stabbed effort drifting wide of the post. But Liverpool held out to secure a win that moves them up to sixth in the Champions League table. -- Beth Lindop\nLiverpool's resurgence continues, but this is just the start\nWhat a difference a week can make. Only six days ago, Liverpool's season was on the brink after a rotten run of six defeats in seven games. They had crashed out of the Carabao Cup at the hands of Crystal Palace, with their hopes of defending their Premier League title growing bleaker with every passing matchday.\nFast forward to now, and the picture at Anfield looks vastly different. After bouncing back in the league with a 2-0 win over Aston Villa, Liverpool turned in their most impressive display of the season against Madrid.\nThe resilience, tenacity and star quality that was sorely missing during the month of October has returned in abundance following the turn of the month, and head coach Arne Slot -- who had come under fire for the first time in his Liverpool career -- will now rightly be commended for galvanizing a team that not so long ago looked out of both hope and ideas.\nOf course, this does not mean that Liverpool are \"back.\" The season is a marathon, not a sprint, and there will be plenty of other tough tests to come as the campaign progresses, starting with a trip to Manchester City at the Etihad on Sunday. But, for now at least, it seems the good times are back at Anfield. Now it is up to Slot and his players to keep them there. -- Lindop\nDoubts linger about Alonso's Madrid\nXabi Alonso's Real Madrid looked to have put to bed any doubts about their big-game performance with their deserved El Clásico win over Barcelona 10 days ago. But this defeat, and the manner of it, raises more questions. This wasn't a humbling of the scale of the 4-0 loss to Paris Saint-Germain at the Club World Cup, or the 5-2 loss to Atletico in the Madrid derby. But Los Blancos were clearly inferior to Liverpool, second best all over the pitch, and could have lost by far more than one goal.\n- Report: Mac Allister heads Liverpool to win over Real Madrid\n- Trent Alexander-Arnold pens heartbreaking note to Diogo Jota\nAlonso had spoken before the game about Anfield's unique atmosphere: \"The moments when the stadium roars, and creates a positive energy for Liverpool.\" Here, Madrid felt it, but didn't rise to the occasion; instead, they played within themselves. They created just one big chance, for Jude Bellingham before halftime. Otherwise, there was minimal threat, and for a team that contains Bellingham, Mbappé and Vinícius Júnior, that's a major disappointment.\nPicking an extra midfielder in Eduardo Camavinga didn't help, and Alonso's substitutions -- introducing Rodrygo, Alexander-Arnold and Brahim Díaz -- didn't change anything. Alonso insists that his Madrid are still a team under construction, in the early stages of a process, and a long way from the finished article. This display, against a top team -- despite Liverpool's recent Premier League struggles -- reinforces that idea. If Madrid are to make an impression in Europe this season, they'll have to improve, fast. -- Alex Kirkland\nBradley shines as Alexander-Arnold gets unhappy reunion\nEven before a ball was kicked on Tuesday night, the Liverpool fans made their feelings very clear. While former star Alexander-Arnold watched proceedings from the Real Madrid bench, the Kop serenaded his replacement at right back with chants of \"There's only one Conor Bradley.\"\nIt has been a mixed campaign for the Northern Ireland international, with both form and fitness preventing him from truly staking his claim on the position Alexander-Arnold redefined across his glittering Anfield career. But against Madrid, Bradley made sure to show the watching world why Liverpool believe he is the perfect successor to the England international, defending brilliantly against the tricky Vinícius Júnior to help keep Liverpool's fourth clean sheet of the season.\nThe game was barely 15 minutes old when Bradley nicked the ball from Bellingham and slalomed past Mbappé to get his team up the pitch. The maneuver earned him a standing ovation from the crowd, and their support for him was reaffirmed when Alexander-Arnold was finally introduced from the bench in the closing stages. It was not the welcome home the 27-year-old perhaps would have envisioned for himself when he left the club as a two-time Premier League champion in the summer. However, in this hugely partisan city, Alexander-Arnold's exit is viewed by many as an almighty betrayal. The fans voiced their displeasure by booing and jeering every time their former No. 66 touched the ball.\nAbsence, it seems, has not made the heart grow fonder. But if Bradley's star continues to rise, Alexander-Arnold's departure might become a less difficult pill to swallow. -- Lindop\nMbappé quiet at Anfield again\nMbappé looked unstoppable this season -- until he got to Anfield. Mbappé had scored 18 goals in 14 games going into this match -- five of them in the Champions League -- but against Liverpool, he rarely threatened. It was a throwback to last season, when Mbappé began the campaign looking unsure of himself, culminating in a missed penalty at Anfield in Madrid's 2-0 defeat on Nov. 27. He missed another in LaLiga a week later, Mbappé subsequently describing the spell as \"rock bottom.\"\nA year later, this defeat at Anfield wasn't Mbappé's fault. He lacked service, as the attack around him failed to function, and Liverpool kept Madrid at arm's length. But the brief moments of danger he was able to generate didn't go his way, either. Seventeen minutes in, there was a first shot, flying high over the bar. Twenty minutes later, there was an attempted backheel to no one, bringing a promising counterattack to a halt. Midway through the second half, he collided with Virgil van Dijk -- never an enjoyable experience -- and not long afterwards, when an Álvaro Carreras run ended with a ball across the six-yard box, Mbappé was nowhere to be seen.\nHis best chance came in the 75th minute, from a Vinícius Júnior pass. Mbappé's shot, somewhat mishit, spun wide. On the sideline, Alonso jumped in frustration, knowing that a promising situation -- one of just a few all night -- had passed Madrid by. -- Kirkland\nAle Moreno discusses Xabi Alonso's tactical decisions in Real Madrid's 0-1 defeat to Liverpool.\nMatch-winner Mac Allister looks back to his best\nMac Allister could be forgiven for thinking he was experiencing a bout of deja vu. As the midfielder was ushered over to the side of the pitch to receive his Player of the Match award on Tuesday night, he might well have cast his mind back to this time last year, when he also earned the accolade after a star turn against Real Madrid.\nOn that night in 2024, Mac Allister opened the scoring in a 2-0 win for Slot's side, during a spell when he appeared to be operating at the peak of his powers. This season, it has been a different story for the Argentina international, whose campaign was curtailed last term with an unspecified injury that also disrupted his preseason.\nHowever, he still managed to make himself the hero against Madrid, capping off an accomplished midfield display with the match-0wining goal. His drop-off in form has undoubtedly contributed to Liverpool's recent malaise, and it is no coincidence that his two best performances of the campaign -- against Villa and Madrid -- have coincided with the Reds' two best team displays. Keeping Mac Allister fit and firing will be key to ensuring that Liverpool's resurgence is not just a flash in the pan. -- Lindop\nCourtois keeps scoreline respectable\nVan Dijk was laughing. In the 47th minute, Courtois had just saved the giant center back's goalbound header, and the feeling at Anfield was: Isn't this getting a bit ridiculous? Even Courtois allowed himself a brief smile at this latest miraculous intervention, before moving to organize his under-fire defense.\nThe save from van Dijk wasn't Courtois' first outstanding stop of the game, or his second. He had already pulled off two hard-to-believe saves on Dominik Szoboszlai in the first half, one from point-blank range. The Van Dijk save wasn't the last, either. Just a minute later, Courtois tipped a shot from Ekitike over, just as impressively. Then he saved a Szoboszlai free kick. When Mac Allister's goal came, even Courtois was helpless. The header was too close, too powerful, flashing past his head before he had time to react.\nCourtois and Liverpool have history. The goalkeeper's performance in the 2022 Champions League final in Paris -- he made a record nine saves, meaning Liverpool's dominance went unrewarded as Madrid won 1-0 -- was unforgettable. Here, there were eight saves. They didn't contribute to a Madrid win this time, but they did ensure this remained a close contest, when at times, the balance of play was anything but. -- Kirkland", "summary": "(summarizer_error: 401 Client Error: Unauthorized for url: https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions)"}

Right now, the Bundesliga giants are the team to beat on the road to next May's final in Budapest, and they proved it on Tuesday in adversity in Paris.\nIf you can beat Paris Saint-Germain in the Parc des Princes, it marks you out as a team to be feared, but Bayern left the French capital with a 2-1 win despite having been reduced to 10 players before half-time thanks to double goalscorer Luis Díaz being sent off for a dangerous challenge on Achraf Hakimi.\nPlaying with a one-man disadvantage against the European champions -- and arguably the best team in the world, regardless of their FIFA Club World Cup final defeat against Chelsea in July -- Bayern flipped from a display of first-half dominance and flair to turn in a backs-to-the-wall show of defiance in the second half.\nAnd it was all glued together by the stubbornness and ageless heroics of goalkeeper Manuel Neuer, who celebrates his 40th birthday next March, and also the selflessness of Harry Kane, who defended with as much determination as any of his teammates to ensure that Bayern extended their incredible start to the season to 16 successive wins in all competitions.\n- PSG's Achraf Hakimi exits in tears after wild Luis Díaz tackle\n- As it happened: Mac Allister winner for Liverpool, Bayern beat PSG\n- Hunter: Will Pedri's injury expose Barcelona, Spain's dependency?\n\"The main thing for me, and I say it a lot, is that when there is hype, I tell my players, please don't believe it, you're not that good, but if you have a bad performance, you're not that bad either,\" Bayern boss Vincent Kompany told reporters.\n\"We have won 16 and tomorrow it's back to zero. We have to win next the game. But defending with 10 is another token we must take with us through the season.\"\nUntil the dismissal of Diaz in first-half stoppage time -- referee Maurizio Mariani had initially issued a yellow card before upgrading it to a red after a VAR review -- Bayern had cut PSG apart with their breathless counter-attacks, scoring twice through Colombia international Diaz, a £65.5 million summer signing from Liverpool.\nThe manner in which Kompany's team dominated PSG was impressive enough, especially as the Ligue 1 champions were only without the injured Désiré Doué and benched João Neves from their strongest side at the outset of the game. But the six-time Champions League winners deserve their status as favourites to win the competition because they showed they can master both sides of the game -- the attacking and the defending. And the fact that they did it against PSG means that they can justifiably say that they have taken on the best and won.\n\"At 11 against 11, Bayern were stronger,\" PSG coach Luis Enrique said. \"Without a doubt.\"\nIt is easy to dismiss Bayern's domestic dominance as the norm having been crowned as Bundesliga champions 12 times in the past 13 seasons.\nSo their nine-game winning streak in the league so far this season, even including victories against Borussia Dortmund and Bayer Leverkusen, could be regarded as impressive, but not enough to merit being billed as the best team in Europe. The Champions League is a much more reliable measuring stick, though, and Bayern have not had it easy in the league phase.\nThey opened up with a 3-1 win against Chelsea on matchday one and they have now inflicted a loss on PSG, so already they can claim victories against the world and European champions. The likes of Arsenal, Liverpool, Real Madrid and Manchester City will all back themselves against any opponent in the Champions League and they all have the players to beat Bayern but, right now, none can claim to be better than Kompany's team.\nIn the first half in Paris, Kane, Diaz and Michael Olise gave PSG the kind of attacking torment that Ousmane Dembélé, Khvicha Kvaratskhelia and Doué inflicted on the French club's victims on their way to Champions League glory last season. And Kompany's midfield three of Serge Gnabry, Aleksandar Pavlovic and Joshua Kimmich matched up to Vitinha, Fabián Ruiz and Warren Zaïre-Emery in the heart of PSG's line-up.\nDiaz's goals, in the fourth and 32nd minutes, gave a fair reflection of Bayern's control, even though PSG saw a Dembele goal ruled out for offside, moments before a hamstring injury forced him out of the game.\nBut it was the dismissal of Diaz that ultimately allowed Bayern to showcase the other side of their game -- the one that they rarely get asked to show in Germany -- in terms of their ability to withstand heavy pressure from a dangerous opponent. They did so because Kompany's players defended as a team, but also because of Neuer's contribution and that of center backs Dayot Upamecano and Jonathan Tah.\nIf Bayern were a heavyweight title contender, everyone would be aware of their power and attacking threat, but there would also be questions about the strength of their chin. Yet after going toe-to-toe with PSG in their own backyard and emerging victorious, nobody can now ask questions about Bayern's resolve and their ability to hold on against constant attacks.\nThey have the goal threat, from Kane, Olise and Diaz, and also the defensive strength to go all the way in this season's competition. It's still early days in the season, but Bayern are as strong as any team in the world.\n\"The Champions League winner isn't decided now, otherwise PSG wouldn't be the champion last season,\" Kompany said. \"It's about getting through to the next round, going from there and being in this form at the end of the season.\"", "summary": "(summarizer_error: 401 Client Error: Unauthorized for url: https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions)"}

Jeff Borzello, Joe Lunardi and Myron Medcalf break down the highlights below.\nHow capable did Florida look of defending its title despite the loss to Arizona?\nThere is nothing for the Gators to sulk about after losing to No. 13 Arizona, a legit Big 12 contender that showed the college basketball world Monday that it has a star in Peat with Big 12 Player of the Year aspirations.\nThomas Haugh proved he has the versatility to play in the small forward spot he was moved to with an incredible 27 points, but the Florida frontcourt struggled to stop Peat from attacking the rim.\nIn the Gators' backcourt, Xaivian Lee and Boogie Fland had poetic moments in which they demonstrated the benefits of employing two point guards. With under nine minutes left, Lee -- All-Ivy League at Princeton the past two seasons -- hit Fland with a no-look pass and the former Arkansas star finished in the lane and drew a foul. That said, there were stretches in which they gave into their instincts, and the offense didn't consistently flow with two natural distributors who arguably forced too many shots.\nFlorida's defensive challenges -- the Gators surrendered 50 points in the paint -- is its biggest priority after Monday's loss. And the chemistry the Gators will need to chase another title will require more time with their new backcourt. Despite the loss, Florida has the players to make another run. -- Medcalf\nCould Koa Peat play himself into the freshman of the year conversation?\nPeat produced one of the best college debuts we've seen in recent years, finishing with 30 points, 7 rebounds, 5 assists and 3 steals in a win over Florida -- and what looked like the best returning frontcourt in the country.\nThe versatile forward was the West Coast version of Cameron Boozer in the class of 2025, winning everything at the high school and international level while producing consistently over all four years. Now he's making a case that the big three of Darryn Peterson, AJ Dybantsa and Boozer at the top of this class is a big four, at minimum.\nAccording to ESPN Research, Peat was the first player in Big 12 history to have 30 points and 5 assists in their career debut. He looked as if he's ready to carry a talented Arizona team this season. -- Borzello\nHow did AJ Dybantsa look in his debut for BYU?\nDybantsa will look back and regret some of his missed layups and free throws (2 of 7 from the line), but the top-ranked recruit still finished with 21 points, 6 rebounds and 3 assists in No. 8 BYU's 71-66 win over Villanova. More importantly, he came up with big play after big play when the game got tight late in the second half.\nWith the score tied at 59, Dybantsa recorded six of the next eight points, finishing in a variety of ways. He was surprisingly denied at the rim on a couple of occasions, but for the most part, was able to get to his spots for either short midrange jumpers or finishes at the rim.\nWith his size, athleticism, body control and playmaking ability, Dybantsa is just too much of a force for most defenders to handle. -- Borzello\nHow did Darryn Peterson look in his debut for Kansas?\nPeterson had a 3-pointer and a dunk before the first media timeout and didn't slow down until halftime. The potential NBA No. 1 pick had 18 points, 3 rebounds and 3 assists in 17 first-half minutes, and with the game out of reach, Bill Self didn't need his star freshman much after the break. Peterson played only five second-half minutes and finished with 21 points.\nHe showed his typical efficient offense, going 7-for-11 from the field and making three 3-pointers. One positive sign for Kansas' offense as a whole was that Peterson and Flory Bidunga (23 points) look like a potentially dominant inside-outside duo after Bidunga was clearly the focal point after Peterson. Being a high-usage option in the post isn't something we saw from Bidunga as a freshman or in October's exhibition games, but it would benefit Peterson from a balance perspective. Friday's trip to North Carolina should be more telling for both Peterson and Bidunga. -- Borzello\nDarryn Peterson gets up for the beautiful jam\nWhat did we learn from some of the other freshmen debuts?\nEach player's ranking in the SC Next 100 for the class of 2025 is listed in parenthesis.\nNate Ament (No. 4), Tennessee\nAment had some questions after his performance against Duke in last month's exhibition game, particularly surrounding his shot selection and efficiency on offense. He was much better in Monday's 76-61 win over Mercer, going 6-for-11 from the field and finishing with 18 points and nine rebounds. His activity on the glass has been surprisingly impressive early, given he also was productive in that area against the Blue Devils. Ament's usage is not going to be in doubt moving forward, as Rick Barnes' team needs the freshman's explosiveness on offense. The shotmaking that made him so sought after at the high school level will come around. -- Borzello\nCaleb Wilson (No. 5), North Carolina\nThe five-star recruit has a claim that even Michael Jordan can't match. After his 22-point performance over 25 minutes in a 94-54 win over Central Arkansas, Wilson became the fifth North Carolina freshman to score 20 or more points in his debut, according to ESPN Research. The 6-foot-8 standout and his teammates faced an opponent ranked 348 out of 365 teams in KenPom's preseason rankings, which means it will only get more challenging from here. But Wilson (also 3 assists, 1 steal and 1 block) affected the game on multiple levels in an efficient effort by the freshman. -- Medcalf\nCaleb Wilson elevates for slam dunk vs. Central Arkansas Bears\nDarius Acuff Jr. (No. 7) and Meleek Thomas (No. 11), Arkansas\nJohn Calipari has a strong track record with elite guards. Derrick Rose, John Wall, De'Aaron Fox and others have been the anchors for Calipari's best teams. Acuff and Thomas could be next in line after the duo finished Monday's 109-77 win over Southern with a combined 53 points (7-for-15 from 3), 11 assists, 4 steals and only 3 turnovers. The talented freshmen could be the catalysts for a team with veterans such as Trevon Brazile (25 points on Monday). It was a strong debut for the young Arkansas guards. -- Medcalf\nHow did Steven Pearl's debut leading Auburn go?\nPearl's first game went about as bad as anyone could have imagined.\nBethune-Cookman, a plus-25.5 underdog at ESPN BET heading into the game, left the gym with its head held high after it took the No. 20 Tigers to overtime on the road. The Wildcats (236th on KenPom) had the lead with 2:05 to play, then hit three free throws at the end of regulation to force overtime. Yes, Pearl's squad escaped with a win in his first game, but any projections about Auburn as a potential SEC sleeper -- Tahaad Pettiford is the only player on the team who logged minutes in the Final Four last season -- were likely erased after the effort Monday.\nThe Tigers have a lot to prove after they nearly lost at home to a team that made 55% of its 3-pointers. -- Medcalf\nBethune-Cookman Wildcats vs. Auburn Tigers: Game Highlights\nWhich top-25 team surprised you?\nIn retrospect, we should have given more preseason respect to an Arizona team that returned three starters from a Sweet 16 roster and then added two top-15 recruits. The Wildcats are loaded with talent, with a group of prospects bettered only by Duke from top to bottom. But coming together this quickly? Against the reigning national champs? That was unexpected. Their performance takes them from the \"second-weekend threat\" to \"Final Four contenders\" tier for me.\nPeat was terrific and looked like the go-to offensive focal point this team needs, but Jaden Bradley taking a step forward was a difference-maker. He did whatever he wanted late in the game against Florida's guards, scoring 10 straight points at one point.\nThe scary part is there's still room for the Wildcats to grow. They didn't do much to answer pressing questions about perimeter shooting, although Ivan Kharchenkov made a pair of 3s. And Brayden Burries had only three points while Dwayne Aristode played only six minutes. -- Borzello\nOver the summer, Brad Underwood was concerned that immigration issues could disrupt his team's start to the season. Instead, the Illini pummeled SWAC contender Jackson State by a tidy 58 points in one of the more impressive blowouts on an opening night schedule full of them. More importantly, it served to remind us that Purdue has multiple challengers in a deep and Final Four-minded Big Ten. Along with the Boilermakers, Michigan and perhaps UCLA, let's add Illinois to the list of legitimate contenders to finally end the conference's long national championship drought.\nLouisville is also worth an honorable mention. The Cardinals held South Carolina State to 15 first-half points, rolling to a 104-45 victory. -- Lunardi\nJackson State Tigers vs. Illinois Fighting Illini: Game Highlights\nMere days after a judge granted him an injunction to play this season, Tyon Grant-Foster didn't waste any time finding his place on a Gonzaga team with multiple standouts. He, Graham Ike and Braden Huff combined for 42 points to lead the charge for the Bulldogs, who scored more points in the second half (52) than Texas Southern did for the game (43). Considering all it has required for Grant-Foster to get here -- the 2023-24 WAC Player of the Year struggled at Grand Canyon last season before spending this past offseason working legal channels to secure another year of eligibility after injuries and cardiac ailments cost the 25-year-old multiple season -- it was surprising that he played like someone who was further removed from all of that drama. -- Medcalf\nWhich team outside the top 25 surprised you?\nOver the past four seasons, Boise State has gone to three NCAA tournaments. In the one season the Broncos fell short (2024-25), they won 26 games and were one of the last teams left out of the field. They were picked third in last month's preseason Mountain West poll with the widespread expectation that Leon Rice's team would get back to the tournament. But that potential bounce-back season got off to a brutal start as Boise State lost 79-78 at home to Division II Hawaii Pacific -- a team that went 15-14 last season and didn't receive any votes in the preseason Division II coaches poll.\nThere's a long way to go, and games against D2 teams don't technically factor into a team's metrics, but it was maybe the biggest stunner on the opening night slate. -- Borzello\nIt might be unfair given it's the first week of November, but TCU has already put a serious dent in its NCAA tournament bubble chances. Picked 10th in the Big 12 and starting the season at No. 83 on our Bracketology rankings, the last thing the Horned Frogs needed was an opening night no show against a team picked seventh in the Southland Conference and No. 309 on our board. How else can we describe an 18-point first-half deficit in a guarantee game against New Orleans?\nGive the Privateers credit for going into Fort Worth and pulling off a 78-74 win, but this is more about a TCU team desperate to avoid a second straight mediocre season. So far, no good. -- Lunardi\nBaylor lost key players such as Robert Wright III to the transfer portal, was picked to finish seventh in the Big 12's preseason poll and brought in a five-star freshman Tounde Yessoufou, who could be a lottery pick in the 2026 NBA draft. The Bears secured a double-digit win over UT Rio Grande Valley -- a team projected to finish at the bottom of the Southland Conference standings after returning only one starter -- but surrendered 81 points to the Vaqueros, allowing them to score on 56% of their 2-point shots and 41% of 3-point shots.\nBaylor has finished 10th or lower in defensive efficiency in conference play in two of the past three seasons. The Bears might still have questions on that end of the court based on their effort Monday night. -- Medcalf", "summary": "(summarizer_error: 401 Client Error: Unauthorized for url: https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions)"}

A top-10 upset helped tip off the opening day of the 2025-26 women's college basketball season. No. 7 Duke, an Elite Eight team last season, fell 58-52 to No. 16 Baylor in the opener of the Oui-Play doubleheader in Paris.\nThen one of the brightest stars of last season's freshman class, Mikayla Blakes, picked up where she left off, leading No. 19 Vanderbilt over California 75-65. Her 27-point effort in Oui-Play marked her 11th career game of 25 points or more, including two 50-plus-point outings last season.\nAs the rest of day played out, Ta'Niya Latson made her debut in Columbia, South Carolina, and last season's Final Four participants South Carolina, Texas and UCLA all won in blowouts. Here's a look at the first day, and what's coming up for defending national champion UConn, which opens its season Tuesday vs. Louisville (ESPN, 5:30 p.m. ET).\nHow did Latson and the South Carolina backcourt look?\nCreme: The South Carolina backcourt might be the Gamecocks' strength all season. It certainly was in Monday's 94-54 win over Grand Canyon. Latson led the way with 20 points. An even better sign: The career 44.8% shooter did it on only 10 shots. With more talent around her in the backcourt -- Tessa Johnson had 19 points and Raven Johnson had 11 points, 8 rebounds, 7 assists and 3 steals -- Latson played within the construct of the offense. Nothing was forced.\nThere might be games when Dawn Staley will want Latson to take over. She hasn't had a backcourt scorer as talented as the Florida State transfer since at least Allisha Gray on the 2017 national championship team. Laston also had four assists and got to the free throw line eight times, two more good signs that her fit with the Gamecocks, who shot nearly 60% from the field, is a good one.\nRaegan Beers and Jennie Baranczyk break down how Oklahoma was able to power through the Bruins' tough guards and get the victory.\nWhich player were you most impressed with Monday?\nCreme: Ava Heiden, Iowa Hawkeyes\nMost of Heiden's freshman season was spent in the background. Her playing time (9.7 MPG) and production (5.0 PPG) ranged from inconsistent to nonexistent. Then she notched three straight double-figure scoring performances across the Big Ten and NCAA tournaments, realizing some of the potential that made her a top-40 recruit. On Monday against Southern, the momentum hit another gear. Her 21 points and 14 rebounds led the Hawkeyes and were career highs. Iowa struggled early, but Heiden's nine points in a 22-10 second quarter gave the Hawkeyes the cushion they needed en route to a comfortable 86-51 win.\nVoepel: Raegan Beers, Oklahoma Sooners\nBelmont, which finished runner-up to Minnesota in the WBIT last season, is not the kind of mid-major you can take lightly in a season opener. The No. 6 Sooners beat Belmont by 17, but it was a close game until Oklahoma pulled away with about 6 minutes left. The Sooners did it by feeding Beers, their go-to player inside, and she scored six consecutive points to give them some breathing room. The senior's 29 points came on 13-of-17 shooting (76.5%). Last season, she shot 63.3% from the field. That's quite a comfort to have a player such as Beers anchoring the offense.\nWatch the Game Highlights from Baylor Bears vs. Duke Blue Devils\nWhich Top 25 team most surprised you -- good or bad?\nCreme: Maryland Terrapins\nIntegrating 10 new players into the rotation, Maryland played team defense and moved the ball on offense like a team that had been together for much longer than one month of practice. The Terrapins beat Loyola Maryland 80-26, giving up the fewest points since Brenda Frese took over as coach in 2002-03. They made 10 3-pointers and assisted on 20 of 27 field goals without leading returning scorer Kaylene Smikle, who sat out because of a leg injury, and with star transfer Yarden Garzon scoring only three points and committing six turnovers (she did lead Maryland with six assists). Duke junior transfer Oluchi Okananwa, starting the first game of her career, led the way with 18 points.\nVoepel: Baylor Bears\nBaylor, which finished second in the Big 12 last season, brought back just 30.2% of its scoring and 32.7% of minutes played from 2024-25. Starting off with a top-10 team like Duke that is so ferocious on defense was a real test for the Bears. They have to take confidence from winning thanks in large part to their own defense coming through so well, as they outscored the Blue Devils 15-9 in the fourth quarter. All nine Big 12 teams in action Monday won, but Baylor's victory was the most impressive.\nHow did Aaliyah Chavez look in her debut for Oklahoma?\nVoepel: The No. 3-ranked recruit started her first college game, an 84-67 win over Belmont, in which senior center Raegan Beers led the way with 29 points and 10 rebounds. Chavez finished with 16 points, 6 rebounds, 5 assists and 3 steals. She struggled from the field -- 5-of-18 overall, 1-of-8 from 3-point range -- but showed a lot of poise as the type of playmaking guard who should thrive in Oklahoma's offense.\n\"She can put the ball where it needs to go,\" Sooners coach Jennie Baranczyk said. \"And I thought defensively she did some really good things.\"\nCreme: Chavez made only one 3-pointer, but it was a glimpse into her potential. As the first half was drawing to a close, Chavez took an outlet pass, put the ball on the floor and sprinted into the frontcourt. At full speed she was able to stop at the arc and launch a shot that settled into the net as the buzzer sounded. Chavez's speed, balance and range were on full display in one trip down the court.\nShe did struggle -- and so did the Sooners, who couldn't put away the Bruins until the final minutes -- but Chavez's potential and how well she fits the Oklahoma style of play were evident.\nHow did Taliah Scott look in her return from injury and in her Baylor debut?\nCreme: Baylor has lacked a true go-to scorer the past two seasons and Scott, a transfer from Auburn, is expected to change that. If Monday was any indication, she's off to a good start. Not only did Scott lead the Bears in scoring, she delivered when Baylor needed her most -- in crunch time of a close game. Scott scored half of her 24 points in the fourth quarter as the Bears surged ahead, and her free throw shooting (8-of-10 for the game) prevented a Blue Devils comeback in the final minutes.\nIf Scott can stay healthy, which was her biggest issue at Arkansas and Auburn, the Bears have one of the top scorers in the Big 12 and a player to turn to for a big shot in crucial moments.\nVoepel: Baylor coach Nicki Collen said coming into this season that she expected Scott to make a major impact right away, and she did Monday. Collen calls Scott \"a professional scorer,\" comparing her to Minnesota Lynx guard Courtney Williams and former WNBA player Renee Montgomery.\nCollen said Scott can consistently find the \"slivers of space\" to attack and get to the rim, but she also can hit pull-up jump shots and 3-pointers. As Charlie said, injuries have been Scott's biggest concern. In 20 games as a freshman at Arkansas, she averaged 22.1 points, then played just three games last season at Auburn before going out with a wrist injury.\nPoints were at a premium against Duke, which is to be expected. The Bears shot 31.7% from the field, the Blue Devils 29%. Someone needed to come up big offensively to decide the game, and it was Scott.\nHow close did Duke look to the team that won the ACC tournament and made the Elite Eight?\nVoepel: Maybe closer than the Blue Devils wanted to look offensively, considering their scoring struggles in the Birmingham 2 Regional were repeated Monday. In March, they scored 47 points in beating North Carolina in the Sweet 16, then 50 in a loss to South Carolina in the Elite Eight.\nOn the positive side, despite some personnel changes this season, the Duke defense looked a lot like last season. That will continue to be a huge strength for Duke, which held opponents to 56.5 PPG last season, including 48.0 in the postseason (three ACC tournament and four NCAA tournament games). But the need to improve offensively will have to be addressed.\nDoes Toby Fournier look like she is ready to take the next step as a sophomore?\nCreme: If Duke can get 16 points, 10 rebounds and 4 blocks out of Fournier every game, Lawson would probably sign up for that. Fournier averaged 13.2 PPG and 5.3 RPG last season. But if Duke's offensive struggles continue, the Blue Devils might need even more from the 6-foot-2 sophomore.\nWhile the production was there, the efficiency was not. A 52.6% shooter a season ago, Fournier was 5-of-15 from the field against Baylor and missed 5 of 11 free throw attempts. With Duke struggling to score, taking advantage of every opportunity is a must. That means Fournier shooting at a higher percentage. It's a lot to ask of any one player to be better than Fournier's performance on Monday, but with a challenging nonconference schedule and the ACC gauntlet, Duke will have to score more -- and Fournier is a big part of that.\nMikayla Blakes makes a great defensive play for the steal\nWhat should we expect from Blakes this season?\nVoepel: More of the same. After averaging 23.3 PPG in her first season at Vanderbilt, she had an outstanding summer, leading Team USA to the AmeriCup title in Chile. On Monday, the Commodores trailed Cal by two points at halftime, but then took over the game by outscoring the Bears 24-9 in the third quarter.\nBlakes was 9-of-27 from the field and 7-of-10 from the line in 40 minutes. She led Vanderbilt in minutes played last season, averaging 32.2. With forward Khamil Pierre, Vandy's second-leading scorer last season, having transferred to NC State, even more is on Blakes' shoulders this season.\nKendra Andrews previews the biggest storylines in women's college basketball ahead of the start of the season.\nWhat's the biggest thing you're watching in UConn's debut Tuesday?\nCreme: What will the Huskies' rotations look like?\nIt will be intriguing to see how Geno Auriemma uses all of his depth: a talented freshman class led by Blanca Quiñonez, impact transfers Serah Williams and Kayleigh Heckel, stars Sarah Strong and Azzi Fudd and a group of experienced role players.\nHow often will Jana El Alfy or Ice Brady join Strong and Williams to form a big lineup? KK Arnold and Ashlynn Shade got the starts in the backcourt alongside Fudd in the Huskies' two exhibition games. How will the minutes distribution between those two and Heckel work? What role does Quiñonez fill? What impact can Caroline Ducharme have after missing the majority of the past two seasons?\nThese questions won't be completely answered against the Cardinals, but what happens on Tuesday will begin to shape the rest of the season.\nVoepel: How Williams adjusts to a bigger role and spotlight.\nWilliams averaged 16.4 points and 8.6 rebounds while shooting 51.5% from the field in 91 games over three seasons at Wisconsin. But the Badgers are one of the least-successful power conference programs in women's hoops over the past two decades: Their only NCAA tournament appearance in the past 23 years came in 2010. So Williams hasn't had much publicity in her college career, which changes dramatically at UConn. We will begin to find out Tuesday how she will handle the scrutiny, how big her role will be, and how good a WNBA prospect she is.\nAlexa Philippou: How Sarah Strong and Azzi Fudd look to begin the season.\nThe way Strong started her collegiate career last season suggested she could end up being one of the greatest ever to come through Storrs. What does Year 2 look like for her? Fudd, the Huskies' other All-America candidate, enters this campaign as the reigning Final Four Most Outstanding Player, but can she put together her most dominant -- and consistent -- season yet in her final act at UConn?", "summary": "(summarizer_error: 401 Client Error: Unauthorized for url: https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions)"}

Arsenal, Manchester City and Liverpool were the clear top three heading into the Premier League season, and Arsenal, Manchester City and Liverpool are the current top three.\nIn other words, you could've taken a two-month nap the night before the Liverpool vs. Bournemouth season-opener and you wouldn't have really missed anyth-- OK, fine. Beyond the top three in the table, pretty much nothing has gone to plan.\nMan City lost two of their first three matches. Liverpool won five in a row and then lost four in a row after they lost four matches -- total -- last season. Bournemouth, who lost 75% of their backline to big-money transfers to big-name clubs over the summer, have the same number of points as Liverpool, as do newly promotes Sunderland, who finished fourth in the Championship last season.\nThe points gap between Arsenal in first and City in second is the same size as the gap between City and Brentford, who are 12th. One spot lower, in 13th? Newcastle, who are currently ahead of Barcelona and Liverpool in the Champions League standings.\nAnd after two straight years of all three promoted sides immediately getting relegated, instead it's West Ham, Nottingham Forest and Wolves who comprise the bottom three. They've combined for three wins and four total manager firings; every other team in the league has at least three wins, and they all have the coach who was on the sideline when the season started.\nNow, the 10-game mark is when we're supposed to start to get a clear idea of what's happening, when the random swings of the first few months of soccer start to coalesce into something real. At least, multiple studies have found that a team's collective performance, as measured by a number of different team-strength metrics, starts to become predictive of that team's future performance right around now.\nIf that's true, then what can the wild season so far tell us about the rest of the season to come? Here are our projections for the final 28 matches, and our projected final table positions for all 20 Premier League teams.\n- Ranked: Top 50 players of Premier League season\n- How Arsenal can be stopped from winning the league\n- 15 next-generation stars to keep an eye on\nHow we're predicting the rest of the season\nRather than doing a much more complex and perhaps much more mathematically sound projection, this approach will be something simpler: (1) because it's easier to understand, and (2) because that makes it easier to glean insights from what the projection tells us.\nI've written about this so many times that I fear I will soon develop a very specific kind of hand arthritis from the repeated motion of my fingers toward these letters, but my favorite single-number to project future team performance is what I call \"adjusted goal differential.\" This comes from a study by former AC Milan data researcher Ben Torvaney, which discovered that a blend of 70% expected goals and 30% actual goals better predicted future point totals than either goals or xG alone or any other blend of the two.\nKnowing that, I then looked at the relationship between a team's adjusted goal differential after 10 games and their points won over the final 28 matches. Based on data from the past 10 Premier League seasons, a team with a neutral adjusted goal differential after 10 matches would be expected to win 1.39 points per game for the rest of the season. And then every goal increase of adjusted goal differential increases the point per game expectation by 0.47 points.\nOf course, 10-game performance can't tell us everything; otherwise, we could just shut up shop right now and give these guys seven months off until the men's World Cup.\nAnd, well, there is one number that's even more powerful in predicting future performance than this blend of goals and expected goals: how much teams pay their players. Even more so than the 10-game performance horizon, the correlation between player wages and team performance has been heavily studied. Most recently, analyst Paul Johnson has looked at how the estimated player values on Transfermarkt can predict how many points a team wins in a season. He found, among other things, that a 10% increase in a team's value increases a team's point total in a season by about a point and a half.\nNow, neither of these numbers can tell us everything, but I'm using them because there's an intuitive logic to each one. Adjusted goal difference acknowledges the importance of creating better chances than your opponent as the main driver in team success, but it also accounts for the fact that sometimes teams play differently after a goal is scored and it also picks up some of the stuff for which xG models can't fully account.\nAnd then market values are just a proxy for talent. Even the best managers will tell you that player quality is the main driver of team performance. But sometimes a bunch of great players play poorly at the same time, or a bunch of good players get injured at the same time or a talented group of players needs more time to figure out how to play together. Adjusted goal differential wouldn't account for any of this, but we can all agree that these things happen. The market value value input at least attempts to account for this.\nFinally, to figure out how to weigh each input, I looked at betting projections for season point totals. Given the financial incentives at play and the continued, insanely profitable existence of sports books, these are going to be the most accurate publicly available \"projection systems.\" I then chose whatever weight brought these projections closest to being in line with the markets: 64% transfer values and 36% adjusted goal differential.\nWith that, here is how the Premier League season is projected to finish:\n1. Arsenal\n• Projected points total: 79.3\n• Projected rest of season total (rank): 54.3 (1st)\n• Market value (rank): €1.31B (1st)\n• Adjusted goal differential (rank): +1.28 (1st)\nThis one is simple: They've been the best team, they have the best roster, and they have a six-point lead on second place. Per ESPN Bet, their title odds are minus-230, or an implied percentage of around 70%.\nIf that point total seems low, it's because the projections in a model like this are always going to be conservative. The teams toward the top and bottom of these projections will likely have more points than what you're seeing here.\n2. Manchester City\n• Projected points total: 68.6\n• Projected rest of season total: 52.6 (2nd)\n• Market value: €1.21B (2nd)\n• Adjusted goal differential: +0.83 (2nd)\nThis one, too, is simple: They've been the second-best team, they have the second-best roster, and they're currently in second place.\nWhen Erling Haaland scores, they've won six, lost one and drawn one. When Haaland doesn't score, they've lost twice. That, also, is simple.\n3. Liverpool\n• Projected points total: 66.2\n• Projected rest of season total: 48.2 (3rd)\n• Market value: €1.15B (3rd)\n• Adjusted goal differential: +0.46 (5th)\nCould this be the first team that actually are better against better teams? At the very least, there has, so far, been a pretty clear correlation between the number of long balls their opponent attempts and how well Liverpool play.\nIn one of Liverpool's better games of the season this past weekend, Aston Villa played just 12% of their passes long -- the lowest proportion of any Premier League opponent. Will either of their next two opponents, Real Madrid and Manchester City, try to exploit this apparent weakness?\n4. Chelsea\n• Projected points total: 65.1\n• Projected rest of season total: 48.1 (4th)\n• Market value: €1.14B (4th)\n• Adjusted goal differential: +0.48 (4th)\nChelsea both manage to be underrated and overrated here. The former is because they've been given three red cards this season and thus played a large chunk of the campaign with fewer players than their opponent. And the latter is because they have such a large roster, and market value doesn't normalize each team to a consistent number of players.\nThat said, it all cancels out in these projections, which leave them pretty much even with Liverpool in the race for third place.\n5. Tottenham Hotspur\n• Projected points total: 59.6\n• Projected rest of season total: 42.6 (5th)\n• Market value: €921M (5th)\n• Adjusted goal differential: -0.04 (12th)\nThis one shocked me. Not necessarily because Tottenham are fifth. They have as many points as Chelsea, and those points aren't going anywhere. But rather, I was shocked that they're expected to have the fifth-most points from now until the end of the season. I mean, what the heck is this? Spurs played this game at home!\nMaybe their roster is more talented than I'm giving it credit for, but this team is good at set pieces, they have a good keeper -- and that's about it.\n6. Manchester United\n• Projected points total: 58.0\n• Projected rest of season total: 41.0 (7th)\n• Market value: €730M (7th)\n• Adjusted goal differential: +0.19 (8th)\nWhile I didn't like their transfer window in terms of increasing their chances of eventually winning another Premier League title, I did think it made them better in the short term. A sixth-place finish would be a nine-spot improvement on last season.\n7. AFC Bournemouth\n• Projected points total: 56.2\n• Projected rest of season total: 38.2 (10th)\n• Market value: €448M (12th)\n• Adjusted goal differential: +0.15 (9th)\n8. Crystal Palace\n• Projected points total: 55.4\n• Projected rest of season total: 39.4 (8th)\n• Market value: €485M (11th)\n• Adjusted goal differential: +0.59 (3rd)\nWe're taking Bournemouth and Palace together because Bournemouth are higher in the table, but Palace are the better team. From a \"Can somebody new crack the top five?\" perspective, you would rather see the better team be the one with more points already in the bag. And Palace have a better adjusted goal differential than everyone other than Arsenal and City, but they're two points and five spots behind Bournemouth in the table.\nMaybe we get lucky and the points haul lets Bournemouth hang around while Palace's performances start to match their results better. I'm not convinced that these teams aren't better than United and Spurs.\n9. Brighton & Hove Albion\n• Projected points total: 53.8\n• Projected rest of season total: 38.8 (9th)\n• Market value: €521M (10th)\n• Adjusted goal differential: +0.34 (6th)\nIs this really it? Brighton have an older team than Manchester City so far this season, but a turn toward a peak-age roster hasn't produced an upturn in results or performance. Given what we've seen from them in past years with possession-oriented managers and ace data-driven recruiting, I really want this team to be fun and exciting and good. Over the past two seasons, it feels like that only happens once or twice a month.\n10. Newcastle United\n• Projected points total: 53.6\n• Projected rest of season total: 41.6 (6th)\n• Market value: €752M (6th)\n• Adjusted goal differential: +0.25 (7th)\nPut another one in the \"just make Newcastle have the ball and you'll win\" basket after Sunday's lopsided 3-1 loss to West Ham when Eddie Howe's team had 62% of the ball:\nComing into this weekend, Newcastle would've been my pick for \"best team after the top four\" from now until the end of the season -- and they still might be. But, come on: this is West Ham, you guys! You're in the Champions League! They're old and bad!\nAlthough 10th feels really low, the gap between Newcastle's projection and Tottenham's projection is smaller than the gap between Tottenham's and Chelsea.\n11. Sunderland\n• Projected points total: 52.7\n• Projected rest of season total: 34.7 (15th)\n• Market value: €340M (18th)\n• Adjusted goal differential: +0.01 (11th)\nWith matches against Arsenal, Liverpool and Manchester City among their next five, Sunderland probably aren't going to hang around the top four much longer. But Sunderland are still hanging around the top four! You don't need me to read you off the underlying numbers and tell you this is unsustainable, but the fact that Sunderland have played well enough to even be in the realm of some good fortune propping them up into the top four was close-to-unthinkable before the season started.\nIt might seem disappointing that they're only projected to win the 15th-most points from here on out, but that number not being 19th- or 20th-most is a massive victory for a club that was favored to go right back down after getting promoted.\n12. Aston Villa\n• Projected points total: 50.5\n• Projected rest of season total: 35.5 (12th)\n• Market value: €546M (9th)\n• Adjusted goal differential: -0.42 (16th)\nVilla are on the verge of becoming the Manchester United of the midtable: an expensive and theoretically talented squad with awful performances masked ever so slightly by not-quite-as-awful results. This is the second-oldest team in the league, too.\n13. Brentford\n• Projected points total: 49.0\n• Projected rest of season total: 36.0 (11th)\n• Market value: €435M (13th)\n• Adjusted goal differential: +0.02 (10th)\nA warning to all: I'm going to write about Michael Kayode whenever given the chance. If \"kicking a moving ball\" was not the main component of soccer, then he would be the best player in the world. His throw-ins should be studied by NASA. He almost never loses any challenges in the air. And he's a stompy, lumbering and somehow-effective dribbler. He just can't pass very well.\n14. Everton\n• Projected points total: 46.8\n• Projected rest of season total: 34.8 (14th)\n• Market value: €415M (14th)\n• Adjusted goal differential: -0.19 (13th)\nWhen David Moyes was first with Everton, he was a Sir-Alex-Fergusonian figure who controlled everything at the club from lineups to signings to what ply toilet paper was used in the visitors' locker room. Soccer has changed quite a bit since then, and I'm not sure how much of a say Moyes has on who his team are signing these days.\nWhy mention this? Well: Three of Everton's major acquisitions this summer, Tyler Dibling, Thierno Barry and Adam Aznou, have combined to make three Premier League starts.\n15. Fulham\n• Projected points total: 44.9\n• Projected rest of season total: 33.9 (16th)\n• Market value: €374M (17th)\n• Adjusted goal differential: -0.25 (15th)\nI had been waiting for Fulham's strategy of not signing any promising young players who weren't cast off by Arsenal to rear its head, and it feels like we finally might be there. This is the third oldest team in the league, and they're starting to slip back down toward the relegation places after a few seasons of midtable consolidation.\nThe one saving grace, and the major weakness of these predictions: they don't account for schedule strength. If we look at the adjusted goal differentials of a team's opponents and where the games were played, Fulham have played the hardest schedule in the league so far.\n16. Leeds United\n• Projected points total: 44.2\n• Projected rest of season total: 33.2 (17th)\n• Market value: €316M (19th)\n• Adjusted goal differential: -0.23 (14th)\nBrenden Aaronson is second for Leeds in non-penalty expected goals and third in expected assists. Combine the two together, and he's the team leader in expected attacking contribution. Is that good news for Aaronson? Bad news for Leeds? Possibly both?\n17. Nottingham Forest\n• Projected points total: 41.5\n• Projected rest of season total: 35.5 (13th)\n• Market value: €645M (8th)\n• Adjusted goal differential: -0.72 (18th)\nOur basic model is essentially making the argument that Forest are too talented to get relegated. And that, too, would be the argument I'd make against Forest getting relegated.\nSean Dyche is a good manager and there should be enough competent players on this roster to find a collection that'll make it work. But they're four points from safety already, so there is now a non-zero chance that this team get relegated, win the Europa League, and play in both the Champions League and Championship next season.\n18. West Ham United\n• Projected points total: 38.8\n• Projected rest of season total: 31.8 (19th)\n• Market value: €401M (15th)\n• Adjusted goal differential: -0.78 (19th)\nWas the win over Newcastle a sign of progress under Nuno Espirito Santo? He changed up the base of his midfield completely, and perhaps that will make a material difference going forward. But even if it does, it's hard to see this team doing anything other than fighting relegation from now until the end of the season.\n19. Burnley\n• Projected points total: 37.8\n• Projected rest of season total: 27.8 (20th)\n• Market value: €247M (20th)\n• Adjusted goal differential: -1.17 (20th)\nThey've somehow managed to win three games, but this is the worst-performing team in the league with the worst roster in the league. They're bottom of the league in both expected goals for and against; they have the worst defense in the Premier League, and the worst offense in the Premier League.\nEven with three wins, a draw and a three-point lead on 18th-place West Ham, Burnley surviving this season would shock me.\n20. Wolverhampton Wanderers\n• Projected points total: 33.9\n• Projected rest of season total: 31.9 (18th)\n• Market value: €377M (16th)\n• Adjusted goal differential: -0.69 (17th)\nHere is a stat I couldn't believe: Wolves, who are currently in 20th place, have a better xG differential than Tottenham, who are currently tied for fifth. As far as I've been told, though, actually kicking the ball into the goal plays a pretty important role in terms of how they determine the winner at the end of every game.\nGiven that not-terrible chance creation and suppression, the model sees Wolves winning more points than Burnley and West Ham from now until the end of the season. The problem: they still have zero wins and only two total points.", "summary": "(summarizer_error: 401 Client Error: Unauthorized for url: https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions)"}

With midfielder injured, we're about to find out", "url": "https://www.espn.com/soccer/story/_/id/46832321/barcelona-pedri-spain-injury-analysis-laliga-world-cup-qualifying-graham-hunter", "published": "2025-11-04T17:15:42+00:00", "cleaned_text": "Pedri's injury absence could hardly have come at a worse time for Barcelona or Spain. However, for everyone who's been arguing that Barça and the reigning European champions are far too dependent on their little midfield genius, it's come at the perfect time to test the contenders to his throne. It's also a great moment to examine how coaches Hansi Flick and Luis De La Fuente try to cope in the coming weeks while Pedri recovers from a thigh injury.\nHere are the stark facts: Barcelona are five points behind LaLiga leaders Real Madrid and outside the Champions League top eight -- which means they'd have to enter the playoff round if they are still there at the end of the league phase -- but need to play Celta Vigo, Real Betis, Club Brugge and FIFA Club World Cup champions Chelsea away from home without their best player this season. In fact, he's arguably been Europe's best midfielder this season.\nSpain, for whom Pedri has been man of the match in each of their last two wins, need good results away against Georgia and at home to Turkey to ensure they win Group E and qualify directly for the 2026 FIFA World Cup. A draw (or defeat) in Tbilisi with Turkey winning their last two fixtures, including against Spain in Seville later this month, would leave La Roja second in the group and needing to sweat it next March against other runners-up.\nUnlikely? Yes, but more likely without Pedri.\n- Yamal paid Clásico price for outburst, but others let him down\n- Barça's Yamal the youngest named to FIFPRO World XI\n- Flick asks Rashford to make more from chances\nIf you've been watching the darting, daring, delightful Canary Islander who turns 23 in a couple of weeks, then you'll already be nodding in agreement. He's a special footballer; a problem-solver, an unpicker of midfields. The ball loves him so much, it seeks him out. Pedri is a man of solutions, a player tailor-made to complement forwards who crave being given the ball in advantageous situations. He's a cool drink in the desert.\nWith Pedri dictating things in midfield in their first two home games of the season, they had 71% possession of the ball in the 3-0 win against Getafe and in the 6-0 over Valencia -- their biggest win this season -- the stat was 72%. But that was the norm. Even in defeat away to a superior Madrid in the Clásico, Flick's team had the ball nearly 69% of the time at the Bernabéu. It partly explains why a more threatening, competitive, quicker Madrid only scored twice instead of the six or seven they threatened to. After all, you need the ball, even if not extravagant amounts of it, to score when you're outplaying your rivals.\nWith Pedri absent at the weekend for the home game against newly promoted Elche, Spain's champions \"lost\" the possession battle, 49% to 51%. A really dramatic drop-off; Elche used that ball gain not only to score, but to hit the woodwork twice, although they still lost 3-1 (stream a replay on ESPN+ in the U.S.). Elche's own match report on their official website even said: \"Pedri's absence obliged Frenkie De Jong to 'multiply himself' and when he tired in the final third of the match, Barcelona weren't able to keep the ball, threaten us or play consistently.\" Their rivals know.\nLaLiga lists Pedri as the guy who's made most passes (893) this season even after missing 90 minutes on Sunday. Football publication Marca list him as the third-best in LaLiga at \"recuperating\" possession (behind Álvaro Carreras and Luis Milla, who've each played a game more) with 65 successes. And in Europe, UEFA's Champions League stats show that Pedri is just outside the top five midfielders for successful/accurate/completed passes this season (193), but that he's got a higher pass accuracy (94.3%) than each of the players who have completed a higher number of passes than him. It means that they've been on the pitch more and passed the ball more but, pound-for-pound, Pedri is still the most successful and accurate of any Champions League midfielder this season.\nThose who care about Barcelona will wince at the memory of Xavi's last season in charge, and how they tried defending their LaLiga title without Pedri. The midfielder had three long injury absences during the 2023-24 season, costing him 131 days and 25 matches for club and country. Barcelona lost both Clásicos that year -- one when he was out injured and the other when he was just back but nowhere near fully match-fit.\nIndeed, the number of points surrendered when Pedri was either absent or returned to play minor minutes match, exactly, the margin by which Carlo Ancelotti's Madrid won the title (10). And just to tie a ribbon on all this, the only two matches De La Fuente has lost as Spain coach in 90 minutes (a Euro 2024 qualifier in Scotland and a friendly against Colombia) both took place when Pedri was out injured.\nCoincidences? Judge for yourselves.\nWhile Pedri recovers, the natural new partner for De Jong is Marc Casadó. You remember him? He had utterly brilliant assists for Robert Lewandowski and Raphinha against Real Madrid and Bayern Munich at this stage last season -- plus a five-star, man-of-the-match performance on his full debut for Spain in a 3-2 win against Switzerland in Tenerife.\nThe 22-year-old Catalan is different from the sorcerer to whom he is apprentice. He tends to play as a deeper-lying midfielder -- someone who's on the ball less often, but is more dedicated to defensive organisation. He's clever in the speed of his distribution, and a Tasmanian devil of a tackler. All-round, Casadó is fun to watch and a fanatical fan of the club he plays for.\nWhen picked in the XI, Casadó will liberate De Jong -- or Dani Olmo, Fermín López or Marc Bernal, all of whom can play No. 8 in the midfield double pivot -- to surge forward, break lines and associate with the strikers. It's a big opportunity. one for which he's yearned, and one for which he needed the help of a sports psychologist in order to wait patiently.\nCasadó told Mundo Deportivo: \"I'm very ambitious, and that can sometimes backfire. You get frustrated and nervous when playing opportunities don't come to you. My family and friends calm me a lot, and finding a sports psychologist helped when I was working my hardest, but not getting game time. That frustrated me quite a lot.\n\"In my head, I kept telling myself that if I wasn't getting the opportunity, it was because I wasn't really giving it my all. So frustrating to know that I was giving it my all, but at the same time, to hear the subconscious voice that I could give more!\n\"Working with professionals helped me stay calmer because not everything depends on you. You can be giving your best, and the coach doesn't trust you, doesn't use you. You have to stay calm in your work and keep doing the same thing.\"\nI'll bow to no one in my view that while Pedri's a whole different creative force and, on his day, the best midfielder in the world, Casadó is genuinely exceptional. Smart, quick, tough, talented and competitive -- so many clubs would bite Barcelona's hand off to have him.\nWhether there's enough time for Casadó to oust others in the Spain national team depends on how fit and available legends like Fabián Ruiz and Rodri are, having suffered difficulties in the last few months. Mikel Merino and Martín Zubimendi would be ahead in the queue too, with Olmo and Fermín (now fit) firm De La Fuente favourites.\nOpportunity beckons for individuals, but there is also a heightened level of uncertainty for Barcelona and Spain. It's time for club and country to demonstrate that despite appearances to the contrary, they don't suffer with dependency on Pedri at all.", "summary": "(summarizer_error: 401 Client Error: Unauthorized for url: https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions)"}

It is normal in that sense.\n\"It's over the top at times as well, but that is because we live in a world where there are so many platforms, so many people can say stuff and will be picked up and made bigger than what it is.\n\"I think it would be good for ex-players that played at the highest level that dealt with difficult moments to put things in perspective.\"\nRooney replied, saying: \"I'm not saying anything more because I think I've spurred them on! We've put them on a winning streak! I think what I've said was fair.\n\"When you win the Premier League and then you go on a run where you lose three, four games in a row, which you don't expect from Liverpool over the last few years.\n\"And then Virgil, you as the captain, that's your opportunity to go and lead the players in. That happens in football and I think the response has been great from Virgil, from the team.\"\nVan Dijk: \"I think if you would watch games, then I would definitely take the responsibility. I think the comment that I signed my new deal, and then it's like that's it, and I let it slide. I think that was a bit...but that's my personal opinion.\"\nAsked if he uses things like that to motivate him, Van Dijk said: \"No. I want to perform for the team, for the club, for each and every one that will support us through thick and thin.\n\"When we go through a tough time as a team, when we're losing games, obviously I'm fortunate that didn't happen too many times, it hurts me so much.

Xabi Alonso's team, top of LaLiga, never really came close to finding an equaliser.\n- As it happened | Teams | Match stats | Live CL table\n- Champions League 2025/26: How does league phase work?\n- Got Sky?

Get Sky Sports or stream with no contract on NOW📺\nAlexander-Arnold, his mural having been defaced on the eve of the game, was booed onto the pitch for the warm-up, when his name was read out by the announcer before kick-off, and finally, most loudly, when he was introduced as a late substitute.\nHis replacement as Liverpool's right-back, Conor Bradley, faced a tough test against Vinicius Junior but had his name chanted regularly by the Anfield crowd as he faced up well to the challenge, even getting the Brazilian booked as he raced forward himself.\nOverall, it was a cathartic performance by Liverpool, Arne Slot's new-look side building on their much-improved showing against Aston Villa on Saturday evening as they look to rediscover their best form following that alarming run of recent defeats.\nThe points lift them into the top eight places in the Champions League table, level on points with Madrid, whose own perfect record comes to an end. The teams may yet meet again in the spring, when Alexander-Arnold will be hoping to have more of a say.\nBradley's game to remember\nOne of the final moments of the match summed up the night. Alexander-Arnold, his every touch being booed, overhit his cross into the box and Bradley was there at the back post to shepherd the ball out of play, dumping Vinicius Junior on his backside.\nThe Anfield crowd enjoyed that, the homegrown replacement for the full-back who walked away from the Premier League champions to join Real Madrid, outshining him. It was tough night for Alexander-Arnold but for Bradley this was a game to remember.\nNot for the first time against Madrid. There was that tackle on Kylian Mbappe last season. This performance was probably more complete, shutting out Vinicius Junior time and time again. It was the sort of display to confirm his status as an elite full-back.\nThere were signs against Aston Villa, but this was another box ticked for Bradley. Slot has had to use Szoboszlai at right-back this season, but with the Northern Ireland international fit again he looks more than capable of cementing that place as his own.\nSlot's praise for Bradley\n\"Conor was outstanding, it was very nice,\" said Slot. \"Last season he was outstanding against Real Madrid, but he had to go off after 80 minutes. When he played 90 minutes against Villa, he again played 90 minutes with incredible intensity against Vinicius.\"\nHave Liverpool turned the corner? \"Let's be clear, we had a very bad run of form in terms of results, no excuse in the world can make up for us losing so many games. But we had to play a lot of games in a small amount of time, there was hardly any rest.\n\"Tonight we played against a team that played on Saturday as well, so both of us had two days' rest. It's helpful to play a home game, because from the last eight I think we played six away from home. The balance can give you just a bit of an edge.\"\nDid Trent coming on help Liverpool?\nAsked whether Alexander-Arnold's introduction helped Liverpool because the atmosphere became even more hostile for Madrid, Slot simply said that the atmosphere was good throughout the game. He revealed that he did speak to the player afterwards.\n\"I gave him a hug, I don't even exactly know what I said,\" responded the Liverpool head coach. \"Every time I will meet him, I will either give him a hug or talk to him, because he's been very special to me as a player and a human being.\"\nAlonso also shut down the suggestion that Alexander-Arnold coming on was a hindrance to his side. \"We needed his quality,\" said the Madrid coach. \"We needed his threat from the wing. It could be expected. Professional, mature, he was ready for that.\"", "summary": "(summarizer_error: 401 Client Error: Unauthorized for url: https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions)"}

Watch QPR vs Southampton live on Sky Sports+ and the Sky Sports app on Wednesday night; kick-off 7.45pm\nTuesday 4 November 2025 22:33, UK\nHovering just three points above the Championship relegation zone, four wins in 51 league games and now on the hunt for a new manager.\nIt has all gone so wrong for Southampton, a club that once appeared a staple of Premier League consistency.\nAnd it never really got going for Will Still. The 33-year-old lasted 13 Championship games in charge after taking his first role in England.\nJust two wins in that time, and only one since the opening day, made his sacking largely inevitable. The Saints are currently 21st in the table. They have not been this low in the pyramid since promotion from League One in 2011.\n- Got Sky? Watch your EFL team on the Sky Sports app\n- Not got Sky?

He may now regret taking his first job in England at a club who had suffered such an abject relegation.\nThey beat Wrexham on opening day but only thanks to two stoppage-time goals. The only other league victory came thanks to some Ross Stewart brilliance against Sheffield United in late September.\nAfter defeat by Preston on Saturday, the situation at St Mary's turned truly toxic. 'Sack the board' chants rung around the home end, as frustration with club owners Sport Republic boiled over.\nThey took over in 2022, sacked Ralph Hassenhuttl and have made a series of questionable appointments since. Nathan Jones was followed by Ruben Selles the season they were relegated.\nRussell Martin managed to return the club to the Premier League via the play-offs, but kicked off their abysmal 2024/25 campaign, with Ivan Juric the man who filled in between Martin and Still.\nIt is just two wins at home since the start of last season.\nWas Still unlucky with results?\nThe underlying data from this season would suggest so, yes.\nIn the Expected Goals (xG) table for this season, Southampton 'should' be fourth in the Championship table. No side is underperforming more.\nStill was clearly coaching performances that created chances, with the problem being that they simply weren't being taken.\nYou can see that both Southampton's main forward options, Adam Armstrong and Cameron Archer, were in the top six for xG underperformance after the first 13 gameweeks of the season.\nThe margins can be so fine in the Championship. And it seems Still's Saints just came out on the wrong side of the divide too many times.\nThere were, at times, chances missed that have to be seen to be truly believed. See Caspar Jander in the video below, spurning a golden opportunity in a game that eventually finished goalless last month.\nSouthampton were, quite comfortably, also the biggest xG underperformers in the league after 13 rounds of games.\nStill's side managed 13 goals, when the data suggests they should have notched 23.\nDespite all that, it felt inevitable that Still's time was up. And he cut a resigned figure after their latest defeat.\nStill in many ways dealt a bad hand\nSky Sports' EFL Editor Simeon Gholam:\nStill had longer to prepare for the start of this season than many, having been appointed way back at the end of May and even being in the stands for their final Premier League game of the season.\nBut business dealings were slow at Southampton, it can only have served to halve his pre-season preparations.\nIn attempting to squeeze maximum value out of departures. the likes of Tyler Dibling and Mateus Fernandes were not sold until the final week of the summer window, meaning arrivals were also delayed.\nTom Fellows and Finn Azaz were top Championship operators last season, but both have struggled to adapt after arriving in the final few days of August, with Jander and Leo Scienza in a similar boat.\nMix that in with a club low on confidence after such a miserable Premier League season, and a fanbase alienated from the ownership of the club, and it is no wonder that Still struggled badly. He was dealt a very bad hand.\nWhat comes next for Southampton?\nPerhaps if there was one more game scheduled before the international break, rather than two, he would have been afforded a final opportunity to turn things around. But instead, the owners decided to act ahead of their trip to QPR on Wednesday night, which is live on Sky Sports.\nQPR have lost three of their last four while the visitors to St Mary's on Saturday are Sheffield Wednesday. It presents Southampton with the chance to get their season motoring as they work out their next appointment.\nBut whoever takes charge - their fourth permanent manager since the start of last season - faces a huge battle to stop the rot.\nAnd his first task will be somehow getting his key attacking players to step up in front of goal and take their chances.", "summary": "(summarizer_error: 401 Client Error: Unauthorized for url: https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions)"}

Arsenal were sloppy in possession as the hosts dominated the opening 20 minutes, with Lukas Provod firing their best chance wide from a good area.\nBut Arsenal slowed down the momentum and stepped onto the game. Bukayo Saka was denied three times by goalkeeper Jakub Markovic - before he eventually got his chance - and it came via a corner.\nSaka's delivery aimed for Gabriel but struck Provod on the arm and VAR helped give a penalty by sending the referee to the monitor. The Arsenal winger dispatched his spot-kick with ease.\nFrom that point, Arsenal knew they would go on to win. They got their second 36 seconds after half-time as Leandro Trossard's cross found Merino completely unmarked and he had a simple finish.\nMerino was at it again as Markovic came and failed to grab Declan Rice's ball into the box, with the Spaniard getting there first to nod home.\nArsenal were home and dry and even brought on Max Dowman, who became the youngest Champions League player at 15 years and 308 days old - with 17-year-old forward Andre Harriman-Annous also making his European debut for the club.\nSlavia thought they were going to get a shot on target, let alone a goal, when Ben White's challenge resulted in a penalty being awarded - but replays showed Provod, who had a tough night, had handled just before the challenge.\nIn a week where Arsenal's injury woes caused concern, their depth and defensive numbers stepped up to help them again. They are top of the Premier League and now the Champions League.\nArteta: A joy to have Merino\nArsenal manager Mikel Arteta:\n“It's a joy to have him [Merino]. It's his versatility on the pitch, the things he can do. It's his mindset, his leadership and the way he is as a person.\n“Mikel hadn't played there [as a striker] in his career but we had a good experience of last season with the way he reacted and performed. We believe today, the way they were set up, it was a good chance for him to perform.\n“He always has good timing, and is capable of finishing the ball especially with one touch. And then it's about talking to him and making sure that he plays closer to the goal.\n“He identifies opportunities, the timing of it and the way he needs to attack the spaces in relation to how they defend.”\nAnalysis: Arsenal’s defence looks unbreakable right now\nSky Sports’ Sam Blitz in Prague:\nFirst, you have to get through the press. Arsenal’s front-footed play makes it impossible for opponents to play out from the back.\nThen you have to get through the low block. Arsenal are up there with the top Premier League teams for distance covered - as they move from that press into a low block that lets nothing through.\nIf you are lucky enough to get through, then there are key duel winners in William Saliba, Gabriel and Jurrien Timber to get past. Declan Rice plays in front of them too.\nAnd if you then get a shot - which six teams have only managed to do three times between them in the space of a month - then you still have to beat David Raya.\nLooking at that formula, it is no surprise Arsenal have managed eight clean sheets in a row. It has needed Erling Haaland to get past this team from open play.", "summary": "(summarizer_error: 401 Client Error: Unauthorized for url: https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions)"}

It was very unpleasant to be the subject of someone's abuse.\n\"I'm trying to do my job. I am one of the few females doing it and I have already crossed over a lot of barriers. It's tough to do your job with that happening.\n\"Fred and Rose West tortured, sexually abused and killed children, so I couldn't really work out why I was being called that. At first it was very, very harsh but then obviously it continued.\"\nMr Wright said: \"How did you feel about that?\"\nMs Ward replied: \"Stress. Anxious. Because you don't know in your head where it's going. You can't escape someone who has more than two-and-a-half million followers on Twitter, not just their tweets but people who latch on and message you and make comment.\n\"It was getting to the stage now where I got a little scared, physically scared really. It was a continuous harassment, what I would call bullying. And you don't know who is out there and how they are going to react, especially in this day and age.\n\"I felt vulnerable going to games.\"\nMs Ward, who played women's football for Leeds United and later became their head of education and welfare before her current 20-year broadcasting career, said she felt \"vulnerable\" when Barton later posted an image of her face and Ms Aluko's superimposed on to a photo of the Wests.\nShe told the court: \"I just thought this is going to explode in a really negative way. It just makes you feel very vulnerable.\n\"I'm in the public eye, I'm always at games and the insinuation with two people who tortured, sexually abused and killed children is not somebody you want to be compared with.\"\nMr Csoka said: \"You understand what would be meant by the expression 'he or she is murdering the commentary'?\"\nMs Ward said: \"Yes, it's not very pleasant.\"\nMr Csoka said: \"Similarly with the photograph of your face and Eni Aluko's face superimposed on the image of Fred and Rose West - obviously not pleasant - but you understand what that analogy was?\"\nMs Ward said: \"I think unless you have been on the receiving end of it… it's horrific.\"\nBarton denies the alleged offences said to have been committed between January and March last year.\nThe trial is ongoing.", "summary": "(summarizer_error: 401 Client Error: Unauthorized for url: https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions)"}

It is in an office where Howard Kendall once entertained dignitaries over a drink.\nThe pennant commemorates the curious bond between the Basque club and Newcastle United, a friendship forged over 30 years ago and one that will be rekindled at Champions League level for the first time when the teams meet this week.\nIt all began in 1994, so the story goes, when an Athletic Club supporter missed their transport back to Bilbao and found themselves stuck in Newcastle following a UEFA Cup tie. \"This is the story that is passed down,\" Adam Stoker tells Sky Sports.\n\"They were put up by a family here and the story got back to Bilbao about the hospitality from our supporters. That is why there was so much warmth for the return leg.\" So started one of the more random but inspiring club connections in European football.\nBack in Bilbao for the second leg, Athletic edged out Newcastle by the odd goal to progress on away goals, the home supporters invading the pitch and racing over towards the travelling fans upon the final whistle. Not to fight them but to applaud them.\nFor Stoker, of Wor Flags, the fan group responsible for the spectacular banners at St James' Park, the story still resonates. \"The people I know who were there just say that you cannot compare it to any football game you have ever been to before,\" he says.\n\"They say that it was the best experience ever. The people did not spend a penny but had their drinks bought for them. The local hospitality was so warm. The scenes of people in the streets, no tribalism, just different cultures getting on, it was great.\n\"It is quite rare to have a relationship like this with an opposing team in football. Athletic was one that we were excited about [when the draw was made] because of that shared history. The only disappointment is that we do not get a trip over there as well.\"\nThe first game that Stoker ever attended was Rob Lee's testimonial in 2001, for which Athletic were chosen as the opposition because of that connection from 1994. When the clubs met again in a pre-season friendly in 2022, the bond was further cemented.\nAthletic presented Newcastle with a flag symbolising the friendship. \"Their captain Iker Muniain presented the flag to me on the pitch,\" recalls Stoker. \"It hangs at St James' every single game. It is just next to the halfway line so it is visible on TV all the time.\"\nJulen Izagirre Garnika worked with Stoker to make that happen. The pair first connected when Stoker was writing about the club's famous fans overseas and there are few more passionate than Izagirre. The Bilbao native fell in love with the Magpies 18 years ago.\n\"It all started with one player, Alan Smith,\" he tells Sky Sports. \"He represented the values that I loved. He was talented but most importantly he was a warrior, fighting all the time. I loved the players, the strip, the badge, the beautiful stadium, the culture.\"\nSince then, he has visited St James' Park on seven occasions, often making the trip from Bilbao alone. \"I even had an away day at Watford.\" He was also too young to attend the legendary UEFA Cup game in 1994, but has heard tales from the Bilbao perspective.\n\"People in Bilbao still tell stories about that day, the older ones tell me how special it was. That the fans got on so well was the cherry on top.\" Not that Izagirre was surprised. The supporters share a passion. \"It's a religion there and it is a religion in Bilbao too.\"\nAthletic remains his first love. \"My grandad is the oldest season-ticket holder for Athletic. We are so proud of him. I think Athletic is the most special club in the world, unique in modern football. I think all true football fans have a soft spot for Athletic.\"\nThat is a reference to the club's famous cantera policy that means they select only players with a connection to the Basque region. Perhaps that resonates particularly with Newcastle supporters? \"I think the areas are quite similar,\" agrees Izagirre.\n\"I am born and raised in Bilbao and 99 per cent of the population support Athletic. Unfortunately, in other cities the local team are losing supporters to the famous teams. That does not happen in Bilbao because this is a unique club, with a special bond.\"\nNewcastle is a one-club city too. \"Bilbao and Newcastle are countries by themselves, that feeling of pride, of belonging. The Basques and the Geordies are so similar. We are brothers from different countries. No other club in the world has a passion like us.\"\nNaturally, Stoker agrees. \"There is definitely a crossover in terms of the passion, the strong sense of regional identity.\" The plan is for those shared principles to be celebrated ahead of the Champions League game between the clubs on Wednesday.\nA flag is being prepared to be presented to Athletic. \"It is a favour we are looking to pay back this week. It is just to symbolise the connection between the two groups of supporters. It started over 30 years ago but that warmth is still there,\" says Stoker.", "summary": "(summarizer_error: 401 Client Error: Unauthorized for url: https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions)"}

This game, he's not available.\"\nAsked if he is concerned or if this is a short-term issue, Arteta replied: \"I am concerned. Because he hasn't had many muscular issues, and he needed to leave the pitch and he was feeling something.\n\"It's never a good sign for a player who is explosive. We are digging in a little bit more to understand the extent and where we are in terms of the injury.\"\nIt is one of seven injuries Arsenal currently have, with most of them in the forward areas. With Havertz also out and Gabriel Jesus a long-term absentee, it leaves the Gunners without a recognised No 9 for the immediate future.\nArsenal have Mikel Merino and Leandro Trossard as makeshift options in that area, but the only other recognised forward is 17-year-old Andre Harriman-Annous, who made his Gunners debut in the Carabao Cup fourth-round win over Brighton.\nAnalysis: Prepare to see a different Arsenal now\nSky Sports’ Sam Blitz in Prague:\nA key attacking player picking up an injury blow? Arsenal have been here before. It has not just become a fortnightly feeling since the start of the season, but also through this entire calendar year.\nBut despite claims that Arsenal have the strongest squad - Gyokeres was one of two players that Arteta could not afford to lose, as the back-up option would take the team in a completely different direction.\nMartin Zubimendi is the other - and he is suspended for the Slavia game - so expect to see a different Arsenal on Tuesday night.\nThe blow for Gyokeres is especially frustrating as the Swede was just getting up to speed. The difference he brought into the Gunners attack was starting to pay off, with runs in behind causing defences to drop and allowing space for other Arsenal attackers to flourish. Even his goals were coming.\nNow Arsenal will likely have to revert back to Merino as their most senior No 9 option. The Spaniard has a decent goal record for club and country, but his natural midfield profile - and a tendency to go deep - is a stark contrast to the Gyokeres game.\nArsenal are in the same position as the back end of last season: without a recognised striker available for now.\nThe February and May period that followed Havertz’s near-season-ending injury saw Arsenal surrender the Premier League title to Liverpool - and while there were positive moments such as the two wins over Real Madrid, Arsenal and Arteta fell short in their objectives.\nArteta’s mood was one of frustration in his Monday press conference, as he fielded questions over injuries and fixture scheduling following the Carabao Cup quarter-final date announcement. He even said his team have no depth anymore.\nTrossard: I could play up front - but left wing is my preferred spot\nArsenal winger Trossard spoke about being an option to replace the injured Gyokeres as the Arsenal No 9, but admitted his recent resurgence at left wing means that is his preferred spot.\nThe Belgian has three goals and three assists this season, and marked his 100th Premier League game for Arsenal with an assist away at Burnley.\n\"I think at the moment it's the left-wing position,\" said Trossard when asked about his preferred role. \"At least I have some consistency there now. I think I have shown that as well on the pitch.\n\"But I’m always able to play in any kind of position in the front positions. So if the manager wants me to play there, I will try to do my best.\"", "summary": "(summarizer_error: 401 Client Error: Unauthorized for url: https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions)"}

It could nearly double in months to come, with the budget for immigrant detention growing by $45 billion over the next three years—at least approximately $14 billion per year—under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act enacted in July. This represents a threefold increase over the $3.9 billion detention budget that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) received for fiscal year (FY) 2025, turbocharging what already stood as the world’s largest immigrant detention system. It also means that the annual budget for immigration detention is now on pace to be 62 percent larger than that of the entire federal prison system, which was $8.6 billion in FY 2025.</p>\n\n<div class=\"source-box-sidebar\">\n\t<p class=\"source-box-title\">In This Article</p>\n\n\t<ul><li>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"source-box-title\"><a href=\"https://www.migrationpolicy.org#turbocharging\">ICE detention had been steadily rising but has increased sharply since Trump's return</a></p>\n\t\t</li>\n\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"source-box-title\"><a href=\"https://www.migrationpolicy.org#conditions\">Most detainees do not have a criminal record</a></p>\n\t\t</li>\n\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"source-box-title\"><a href=\"https://www.migrationpolicy.org#private-prisons\">Private prison companies play a central role in the system</a></p>\n\t\t</li>\n\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"source-box-title\"><a href=\"https://www.migrationpolicy.org#state-local\">The Trump administration is relying on state partners to help detain noncitizens</a></p>\n\t\t</li>\n\t</ul></div>\n\n<p>Detention is key to the Trump administration’s attempt to build a deportation machinery of historic proportions. There were 39,000 detainees in ICE custody when Trump returned to the White House in January 2025, a number that rose to a record 61,000 in late August and could reach as high as 107,000 by January 2026. No prior administration had ever held an average of more than 50,200 people per day in immigration detention (in FY 2019, during Trump’s first term). As of September, detainees spent an average of 44 days in immigration detention, with each detention averaging $152 per day.</p>\n\n<p>To ramp up detention so quickly, the administration has turned to an array of nontraditional facilities, including state-run prisons located in remote areas, soft-sided tent structures, military bases, and even in prisons in other countries. Most importantly, ICE is leaning heavily on private prison contractors, which are playing a critical role in expanding detention capacity and are poised for multibillion-dollar benefits.</p>\n\n<p>In addition to the noncitizens detained by ICE, an unknown number of individuals facing removal have been held in local jails and facilities run by states such as Texas and Florida and other federal agencies including the U.S. Marshals Service and the Federal Bureau of Prisons. The administration is expanding this network of partner state and local jails, which includes facilities labeled by Trump allies with eye-catching names such as Florida’s Alligator Alcatraz and Deportation Depot, Nebraska’s Cornhusker Clink, and the Louisiana Lockup (formally the Louisiana State Penitentiary, also known as Angola Prison).</p>\n\n<p>Immigration detention is civil in nature, and the system’s purpose is to ensure people show up for their removal proceedings and can be deported—in other words be custodial, not punitive.</p>\n\n<p>Yet the Trump administration has leaned into showcasing the harshness of detention, likely as part of its campaign to encourage “self-deportation” or formal voluntary departure. Trump and other top officials have made highly publicized tours through Alligator Alcatraz and similar facilities and the administration is using official social media channels to showcase memes with alligators wearing ICE caps or ASMR videos of shackled detainees being boarded onto deportation flights.  </p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, there have been persistent, troubling reports of poor conditions in detention facilities across the country, including detainees being given spoiled food and non-potable water, facing severe overcrowding, lack of access to showers and clean clothes, and having harsh lights on 24 hours a day. The number of deaths in ICE detention has risen significantly: at least 23 in FY 2025, according to an American Immigration Council tally of ICE’s news releases, compared to 24 who died over the prior four years combined. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) denies allegations of poor conditions as “categorically false,” saying detention standards are being met.</p>\n\n<p>Despite the regular rhetoric from White House and DHS officials that detainees are “criminal illegal aliens,” nearly three-quarters of ICE detainees as of September had no criminal conviction, and many of those who did were for minor crimes such as traffic violations.</p>\n\n<p>This article reviews the growth of the U.S. immigrant detention system, including the reliance on private prison companies as well as state and local prisons and jails.</p>\n\n<div class=\"source-box-sidebar\">\n\t<p class=\"source-box-title\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Get the U.S. Policy Beat in your inbox every month</p>\n\n\t<p><a href=\"https://www.migrationpolicy.org/content/sign-us-immigration-policy-beat\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"210\" src=\"https://www.migrationpolicy.org/sites/default/files/pb-square-250px.png\" style=\"width: 250px; height: 210px;\" width=\"250\" /></a></p>\n\n\t<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a class=\"btn-primary\" href=\"https://www.migrationpolicy.org/content/sign-us-immigration-policy-beat\" target=\"_blank\">Sign Up </a></p>\n</div>\n\n<p><strong><a id=\"turbocharging\" name=\"turbocharging\"></a>Turbocharging the World’s Largest Immigrant Detention System</strong></p>\n\n<p>The One Big Beautiful Bill Act’s $45 billion for immigration detention represents a threefold annual increase for ICE’s custody operations.

Still, administration officials appear to want even faster growth, and have shaken up staffing to achieve this result.</p>\n\n<div class=\"source-box-figure\">\n\t<p class=\"source-box-title\"><strong>Figure 1.

The 61,200 people in ICE detention as of August 24, 2025 were more than at any other point on record. With the new funding, the administration plans to add 41,000 detention beds, including in large-scale detention centers and soft-sided facilities that can be rapidly built up or taken down.</p>\n\n<div class=\"source-box-figure\">\n\t<p class=\"source-box-title\"><strong>Figure 2.

Louisiana in particular has become a key player in the system. The state used to have one of the nation’s highest numbers of incarcerated people, but after criminal justice reforms in 2017 the general prison population declined by 8,000 over five years. This coincided with an expansion in immigration detention during the first Trump term, which represented an opportunity for the state to fill its unused prisons and jails. Today, Louisiana has been described as the busiest U.S. deportation hub, illustrated by the detention facility located on the airport tarmac in Alexandria. From January through July 2025, more than 40,000 people transited the facility, either en route to removal from the United States or to one of the eight other ICE facilities in the state.</p>\n\n<p><em>States, Military Facilities, and Foreign Countries</em></p>\n\n<p>Immigrant detention is not limited to facilities directly run by ICE. State-run facilities such as the newly built Alligator Alcatraz and the Deportation Depot (formally the Baker Correctional Institution) in Florida serve as detention centers for noncitizens, though it is not always clear whether individuals are held under federal or state authority. People detained in these state facilities are not counted in ICE’s official tally (see more on states’ roles below).</p>\n\n<p>The Lone Star Lockup, located at Fort Bliss, is the largest immigrant detention center in U.S. history, according to DHS. Individuals identified for removal are also detained outside the United States, at military facilities such as the naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and the Trump administration has asserted in court that it can legally hold immigrant detainees at any U.S. military facility worldwide. Some noncitizens are also held by foreign governments that have agreed to accept third-country nationals (such as El Salvador and Eswatini), either as a step in their removal elsewhere or for their final destination.</p>\n\n<p><strong><a id=\"conditions\" name=\"conditions\"></a>Who Is Detained and How Are They Treated?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Although promising to target only unauthorized immigrants who are “the worst of the worst,” the administration has deemed millions of noncitizens subject to mandatory detention, bypassing the longstanding practice in prior administrations of allowing most people identified for removal to remain free or on alternatives to detention while their case proceeds in immigration court.</p>\n\n<p>The result has been an increase in the arrest and detention of many immigrants who have not been convicted of or charged with any crime. As of September 2025, 71 percent of ICE detainees had no criminal conviction. Of the 25 percent who had a pending criminal charge, most were minor offenses such as traffic violations.</p>\n\n<div class=\"source-box-figure\">\n\t<p class=\"source-box-title\"><strong>Figure 3. ICE Detainees, by Criminal Conviction, 2019-25</strong></p>\n\t<img alt=\"\" height=\"330\" src=\"https://www.migrationpolicy.org/sites/default/files/source_charts/pb-2025-detention-fig3-conviction.png\" style=\"width: 770px; height: 330px;\" width=\"770\" /><p class=\"source-box-sources\"><em>Source</em>: TRAC, “ICE Detainees.”</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>Under long-held interpretations of U.S. immigration law, federal authorities have discretion whether to detain individuals resident in the United States who are deportable.</p>\n\n<p>They are, however, mandated to detain some subsets of deportable noncitizens. Through a July 2025 policy memorandum, ICE vastly expanded the definition of such groups, deeming millions of unauthorized noncitizens subject to mandatory detention, including many who have resided in the country for long periods. </p>\n\n<p>A Board of Immigration Appeals decision affirmed this position in September, but in dozens of cases federal judges have rejected the new policy, finding that case law and history do not support it. Thus, the legality of this policy remains uncertain, and the question will likely eventually need to be decided by the U.S. Supreme Court.</p>\n\n<p>The Trump administration has also resumed detaining immigrant families apprehended at the border or identified for removal inside the country, a practice ended by the Biden administration in 2021. However, the number of individuals held at ICE’s family detention facilities, known as family staging centers, has remained relatively low compared to the average daily population detained: 358 per day on average in FY 2025.</p>\n\n<p>This figure could grow. As during the first Trump term, the administration has sought to end a 1997 court agreement known as the Flores Settlement, which mandates that children in immigration custody be held in the least restrictive setting possible. That settlement stipulated that the government could not detain children for more than 20 days, and in later interpretations was expanded to apply to families. As before, the Justice Department has argued in court that DHS should be allowed to hold families for longer. In August, a federal judge denied that request. But the One Big Beautiful Bill Act included a provision permitting the indefinite detention of families awaiting a decision on their removal case. Experts have deemed this an attempt to supersede the Flores Settlement, and it will likely be challenged in court.</p>\n\n<p><em>Conditions in Detention</em></p>\n\n<p>Many detainees face challenges finding legal representation and keeping in touch with their family and community support systems, partly as result of the government’s use of detention facilities in remote locations as well as increased fast-track deportations. These limitations are exacerbated by the recent practice of transferring detainees between facilities multiple times within a short timeframe.</p>\n\n<p>Unlike in the general prison system, standards for ICE detention are not codified in law and therefore are nonbinding; compliance varies by facility. As such, there is little government oversight and limited public access and information.  </p>\n\n<p>Press reports and detainee accounts often describe poor conditions. Common complaints include overcrowding, low amounts of food and in poor quality—sometimes even expired—poor air quality, lack of clean water, extreme temperatures, and inadequate bedding. Serious allegations of neglect have also surfaced, including delayed medical care, as well as verbal and physical abuse by detention staff.</p>\n\n<p>Detainees also face anxiety from the uncertain length of detention and overall opacity of the process. Rising arrests will likely increase the massive backlogs in immigration courts, further lengthening detention times. As of September 2025, average ICE detention was about 44 days, with the highest average (111 days) at the Golden State Annex in McFarland, California.</p>\n\n<p>Research has shown that prolonged detention can cause detainees to abandon their claim for asylum or other relief from deportation, opting instead to formally voluntarily depart as a way to leave detention sooner. Some speculate that one of the Trump administration’s aims is to increase these voluntary departures, which are registered in immigration court, as well as unofficial “self-deportations” by unauthorized immigrants who fear being detained. As of early October, DHS data obtained by ProPublica showed that about 25,000 noncitizens had reported their self-deportation via the government’s CBP Home app, which permits receipt of a $1,000 payment upon return and a free flight home for the individual and family members.</p>\n\n<p>U.S. officials have vigorously denied that poor or abusive conditions exist in detention facilities. However, the government has provided little transparency or oversight into the situation inside detention centers. Several congressional Democrats have sued the government after being denied entry, sometimes by force, into immigrant detention facilities to conduct oversight.  </p>\n\n<div class=\"source-box-sidebar\">\n\t<p class=\"source-box-title\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Read all MPI analysis related to the Trump administration</p>\n\n\t<p><a href=\"https://www.migrationpolicy.org/programs/us-immigration-policy-program/data-and-analysis-related-trump-administration-actions\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"167\" src=\"https://www.migrationpolicy.org/sites/default/files/resize/feature_images/trump-immigration-actions2-250x167.jpg\" style=\"width: 250px; height: 167px;\" width=\"250\" /></a></p>\n\n\t<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a class=\"btn-primary\" href=\"https://www.migrationpolicy.org/programs/us-immigration-policy-program/data-and-analysis-related-trump-administration-actions\" target=\"_blank\">Read More</a></p>\n</div>\n\n<p><strong><a id=\"private-prisons\" name=\"private-prisons\"></a>The Role of the Private Sector</strong></p>\n\n<p>Private companies have long been drawn to immigration detention and play a greater role in it than in the general prison system. As of early 2025, close to 86 percent of immigrant detainees were held in privately run facilities, compared to less than 10 percent of the overall U.S. incarcerated population.</p>\n\n<p>To manage the rise in immigrant detention under the Clinton administration, the federal government during the 1990s struck contracts with private companies to provide low-security detention spaces. Two of the largest companies in this sector were—and remain—GEO Group and CoreCivic, which are currently valued around $4 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively. These contractors also run private facilities in the general U.S. prison system, but immigrant detention represents a significant share of their revenues. Records show both companies submitted bids to develop more detention facilities under the new federal funding.</p>\n\n<p>For the private prison industry, immigrant detention represents a profit opportunity on multiple fronts. In addition to government funds for housing individuals, the companies can profit from detainees themselves, who must pay to make phone calls or obtain basic necessities from the generally company-owned commissaries, which sell goods considerably above average market price. Detainees receive pay as low as $1 per day running some of the facilities’ essential services, including food management and laundry. While these jobs are described as voluntary, many detainees have no other option to earn money to supplement their rations.</p>\n\n<p><strong><a id=\"state-local\" name=\"state-local\"></a>The Growing Involvement of State and Local Actors </strong></p>\n\n<p>In addition to rapidly growing federal immigrant detention, the Trump administration is relying on state partners. Building or offering existing bed space and accepting transfers from other jurisdictions has become an easy way for Republican state leaders to curry favor with the administration.</p>\n\n<p>For rural areas in need of economic revival, immigrant detention also presents an economic opportunity. In addition to gaining political capital, local governments often receive commissions from contracts with private prisons, linked to commissary sales. These and other revenue streams can be important amid federal cutbacks. In the last decade, close to 70 percent of newly constructed immigration detention facilities were in rural areas.</p>\n\n<p>The old real estate adage—location, location, location—also matters here. Many newly tapped detention facilities and hubs are located in circuit court jurisdictions that are regarded as among the most sympathetic to the administration’s position on immigration enforcement, meaning noncitizens’ chances of being released are low and their chances of being deported are high.</p>\n\n<p><strong><a id=\"bipartisan-history\" name=\"bipartisan-history\"></a>Immigrant Detention across Republican and Democratic Administrations Alike </strong></p>\n\n<p>The U.S. immigration detention system dates back at least to the 1891 Immigration Act, which solidified the role of the federal government in immigration enforcement. But the system as it currently exists was built largely since the late 1980s and 1990s, as the federal government criminalized drug-related offenses and introduced mandatory minimum sentences, among other measures meant to address crime. The result was a dramatic increase in incarceration generally, which also affected immigrants. Notably, the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 expanded the definition of deportable offenses, thereby increasing the number of lawfully present noncitizens who could be detained for removal.</p>\n\n<p>Congress’s use of appropriations measures to set a minimum bedspace capacity, commonly known as the bed mandate, represents a unique feature of the U.S. immigration detention system. This policy was rooted in national security concerns and has its origins in the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004. Critics charge it with incentivizing arrests, especially of low-priority removable noncitizens.</p>\n\n<p>Congress formally established the bed mandate with its FY 2009 appropriations bill, requiring the agency to maintain 33,400 detention beds per day. The minimum number of beds remained roughly the same throughout the first Trump term and was raised to 41,500 in FY 2024, under the Biden administration. While the congressional mandate has not changed since then, detention has significantly increased. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has stated ICE should aim to hold 100,000 individuals daily, and the agency is well on pace to meet that goal. By comparison, there were approximately 155,000 federal inmates in prison as of October 23, 2025.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What Comes Next After Rapid Growth?</strong></p>\n\n<p>With the help of Congress, the Trump administration is building a vast immigration detention system. Increased detention is upending the lives of many immigrants, their families, and communities.</p>\n\n<p>Questions remain about the long-term consequences of the build-up. If the system’s shock and awe encourage unauthorized immigrants to self-deport or seek voluntary departure, and if incoming border encounters remain at historical lows, there will be less need for immigration detention space in the future.

Even as the scale and urgency of managing migration grows, amid political instability, economic inequality, and rising climate risks, scholars are often unable to influence governments to make policies more effective, evidence-based, and humane.</p>\n\n<div class=\"source-box-sidebar\">\n\t<p class=\"source-box-title\">In This Article</p>\n\n\t<ul><li>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"source-box-title\"><a href=\"https://www.migrationpolicy.org#silos\">Scholars in migration-related fields often work in isolation, so their findings remain fragmented</a></p>\n\t\t</li>\n\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"source-box-title\"><a href=\"https://www.migrationpolicy.org#data\">While the amount of data has grown significantly in recent years, many resources are difficult to access</a></p>\n\t\t</li>\n\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"source-box-title\"><a href=\"https://www.migrationpolicy.org#structural\">Scholars based in Europe and North America tend to have better access to advanced training, research funds, analytical tools, and other advantages</a></p>\n\t\t</li>\n\t</ul></div>\n\n<p>One reason for this disconnect is that many research studies remain fragmented, siloed, or inaccessible. Others reflect a narrow set of voices or an absence of answers to key questions that policymakers face, reducing the opportunity for real-world application. Although scholarly research has the potential to help identify what types of policies work, in which contexts, and for which people, these gaps make it more difficult for policymakers to access timely and relevant evidence at the moments when it is most needed. The lack of impact is all the more unfortunate given the interdisciplinary nature of migration research, which involves scholars from multiple disciplines examining various questions, including the drivers of movement, the outcomes of integration approaches, the impact of remittance systems, the effects of legal pathways, and the risks of displacement.</p>\n\n<p>When asked, researchers identify three systemic issues as being responsible for blunting the policy relevance of much of their work: persistent fragmentation across disciplines and geographies, uneven access to reliable data and methodological training, and deep structural inequalities in whose voices are represented. Each challenge narrows the evidence base and limits the ability of research to better inform policy.</p>\n\n<p>Those findings were contained in the results of a survey led by the authors involving more than 1,800 migration researchers working in more than 100 countries. The survey, which is one of the largest ever of its kind, sought to better understand why migration research often falls short of its policy potential. This article analyzes findings of that survey and compares structures of the migration studies field with others, particularly climate science and global health.</p>\n\n<div class=\"source-box-sidebar\">\n\t<p class=\"source-box-title\"><strong>Box 1. Survey Methods</strong></p>\n\n\t<p>Responses analyzed in this article are from the Migration Platform Survey. The survey was fielded by a team from AidData—a research lab at William &amp; Mary specializing in evidence-based policymaking, development finance, and geospatial analysis—that partnered with the research and development firm Aptima Inc.</p>\n\n\t<p>The survey gathered responses from 1,835 migration researchers in 101 countries, from various disciplines, regions, and career stages, identified through the Scopus academic citation database. The survey ran from April to June 2024.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p><strong><a id=\"silos\" name=\"silos\"></a>Limited Collaboration: Why Silos Weaken Migration Evidence</strong></p>\n\n<p>Migration is not a single-issue domain. Researchers approach it from a range of disciplines, including sociology, economics, anthropology, geography, political science, and public health. Each offers critical insight into the causes, consequences, and lived experiences of human mobility. Yet scholars in these fields often work in isolation. A sociologist studying refugee integration may never interact with an economist analyzing remittance flows or a geographer mapping climate-induced displacement. As a result, findings remain fragmented, making it harder for policymakers to draw on a cohesive body of evidence.</p>\n\n<p>Data from the Migration Platform Survey confirm this fragmentation. Most researchers said they find collaborators through academic conferences (66 percent) or within their own institutions (55 percent; see Figure 1). Conferences have the potential to expand networks and diversify collaborations across disciplines and borders. Yet in practice, this potential is often unfulfilled. A separate, more general survey conducted by the researcher Kalle Hauss, published in 2021, found that fewer than one-quarter of postdoctoral researchers and doctoral students in Germany reported meaningfully growing their networks by attending national or international conferences. Research networks tend to reflect existing hierarchies that are shaped more by geography, seniority, and institutional resources than by shared research needs. Collaborating within one’s own institution, meanwhile, is often convenient and familiar. It requires less effort to build trust, involves fewer logistical or bureaucratic hurdles, and is reinforced by institutional norms that reward internal partnerships. These dynamics help explain why networks remain fragmented, even when researchers express interest in broader collaboration.</p>\n\n<div class=\"source-box-figure\">\n\t<p class=\"source-box-title\"><strong>Figure 1. Migration Researchers’ Methods for Finding Collaborators, 2024</strong></p>\n\n\t<p><img alt=\"\" height=\"329\" src=\"https://www.migrationpolicy.org/sites/default/files/source_charts/fe-2025-researchers-fig1-collab.png\" style=\"width: 770px; height: 329px;\" width=\"770\" /></p>\n\n\t<p class=\"source-box-sources\"><em>Note</em>: Survey respondents could select multiple options.<br /><em>Source: </em>Rodney Knight, Narayani Sritharan, and Kelsey Marshall, <em>Transforming Migration Research: Insights from the Migration Platform Survey on the Creation of an Online Research Platform </em>(Williamsburg, VA: AidData at William &amp; Mary, 2025), <a href=\"https://www.aiddata.org/publications/transforming-migration-research\" target=\"_blank\">available online</a>.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>This siloed structure has real consequences for decision-making. Policymakers designing refugee integration programs, for instance, may consult sociologists working on social cohesion or legal scholars specializing in asylum frameworks, but miss economists’ insights about labor-market impacts or psychologists’ knowledge on trauma recovery. Without these perspectives in conversation, policies are less likely to be holistic or effective.</p>\n\n<p>Professional networks, which 45 percent of researchers said they use to find collaborators, often reinforce these disciplinary boundaries. When policymakers or others ask researchers to suggest additional experts, researchers are more likely to recommend peers within their own field, given existing patterns of collaboration and familiarity. As a result, the flow of knowledge into policy spaces tends to mirror academic silos rather than bridge them.</p>\n\n<p>Mechanisms to break down these barriers and systematically integrate migration research’s inherently multidisciplinary perspectives into policy remain limited. Other fields have experimented with structures to connect evidence across disciplines. For instance, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the World Health Organization’s (WHO) Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE) are high-level groups that seek to gather insights from across the fields of climate science and global health, respectively. Migration research has few comparable platforms. While some organizations convene diverse perspectives, the field as a whole lacks large, consistent scaffolding to ensure these collaborations are broad-based and sustained.</p>\n\n<p><a id=\"data\" name=\"data\"></a><strong>More Data, but Hard to Use </strong></p>\n\n<p>The amount of migration data has grown significantly in recent years, and scholars now have theoretical access to statistics from individual household surveys, censuses, and administrative files, as well as more expansive satellite imagery and mobile phone records, among many other sources. But availability does not guarantee usability. Many datasets are fragmented across platforms, released without sufficient explanation, require expensive software to analyze, or are costly to access.</p>\n\n<p>These limitations are not just about a lack of technical knowledge but reflect structural inequalities. When datasets are fragmented, lack relevant metadata, or are behind paywalls, people without institutional support face significant barriers to accessing and utilizing them.</p>\n\n<p>The Migration Platform Survey found 67 percent of respondents said easier access to curated datasets was a top research need, and 41 percent wanted repositories where researchers could share and access each other’s data. Several noted that, in practice, much of their time is spent locating, cleaning, or reformatting existing data. For many researchers, this burden can be prohibitive, requiring significant time or funding for research assistants. Some reported having to shelve promising research because data were too difficult to obtain or verify, even if they exist.</p>\n\n<p>Because these data challenges affect who is able to conduct research, it dictates whose work reaches decision-makers. When migration data are incomplete or difficult to access or interpret, policy tends to be skewed by research from better-resourced regions and institutions. For example, detailed displacement mapping using satellite imagery is increasingly common in parts of East Africa and Ukraine, where international organizations have invested in this data infrastructure. But similar migration dynamics in places such as northern Cameroon or parts of Central America often go under-analyzed—not because the situations are less relevant, but because researchers in these regions cannot work with the same types of data. As a result, policy responses in under-resourced areas may be slower, less targeted, or not driven by evidence.</p>\n\n<p>Other fields have addressed similar challenges by creating centralized infrastructures that make data broadly usable. For example, WHO’s Global Health Observatory curates and documents datasets that are easily accessible and widely used. Migration research has valuable resources, such as the Migration Policy Institute’s Migration Data Hub or IPUMS’s census collections, but it still lacks a comprehensive, integrated system for geospatial and subnational data.</p>\n\n<p><a id=\"structural\" name=\"structural\"></a><strong>Structural Inequalities: Whose Voices Shape Migration Evidence</strong></p>\n\n<p>The ability to manipulate data is not the only way in which opportunities to contribute meaningfully to migration research are not distributed evenly. Scholars based in Europe and North America, especially at well-resourced institutions, are significantly more likely to access advanced training, funds for fieldwork, analytical tools, and protected time for publishing. These advantages accumulate, shaping both the pace of research and whose voices enter policy spaces.</p>\n\n<p>Findings from the Migration Platform Survey illustrate this disparity (see Figure 2). Respondents’ most commonly cited barriers to exploring new research methods were a lack of funding (72 percent) and time constraints (54 percent). These challenges disproportionately fall on early-career scholars, faculty at academic institutions that require lots of teaching, and those in the Global South. These obstacles limit who can build new methodological expertise or take on ambitious research.</p>\n\n<div class=\"source-box-figure\">\n\t<p class=\"source-box-title\"><strong>Figure 2. Migration Researchers’ Barriers to Pursuing New Research Methods, 2024</strong></p>\n\n\t<p><img alt=\"\" height=\"330\" src=\"https://www.migrationpolicy.org/sites/default/files/source_charts/fe-2025-researchers-fig2-barriers.png\" style=\"width: 770px; height: 330px;\" width=\"770\" /></p>\n\n\t<p class=\"source-box-sources\"><em>Note</em>: Survey respondents could select multiple options.<br /><em>Source: </em>Knight, Sritharan, and Marshall, <em>Transforming Migration Research</em>.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>Importantly, researchers across contexts insisted they were eager to expand their methodological toolkit. Qualitative methods were the most widely used, yet more than one-third of respondents conducting qualitative research reported not using qualitative analysis software. This suggests they do not have access to this kind of software (which tends to be expensive), lack the technical skills to use it, or are relying on other researchers to conduct the analysis, a workaround that still leaves them excluded from parts of the analysis process.</p>\n\n<div class=\"source-box-figure\">\n\t<p class=\"source-box-title\"><strong>Figure 3. Types of Research in Which Migration Researchers Would Like to Expand, 2024</strong></p>\n\t<img alt=\"\" height=\"331\" src=\"https://www.migrationpolicy.org/sites/default/files/source_charts/fe-2025-researchers-fig3-methods-.png\" style=\"width: 770px; height: 331px;\" width=\"770\" /><p class=\"source-box-sources\"><em>Note</em>: Survey respondents could select multiple options.<br /><em>Source: </em>Knight, Sritharan, and Marshall, <em>Transforming Migration Research</em>.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>These hurdles underscore the broader inequalities shaping how migration research is supported. Limited access to software and analytical tools slows down projects and narrows the scope of questions researchers can pursue. Just as significant are institutional barriers: When there is little recognition or incentive to build new skills—such as geospatial analysis—researchers may struggle to justify the investment of time and resources, even when those skills would be directly relevant to their work.</p>\n\n<p>The result is a skewed evidence base with blind spots that have real consequences on policymaking. A government designing refugee integration programs, for instance, may rely mostly on studies from high-income countries, simply because those are the most numerous and readily available, while overlooking the limited amount of research on the drivers of displacement in fragile or conflict-affected states. Policies based on this narrow evidence risk misdiagnosing needs, reinforcing flawed assumptions, or overlooking the structural drivers of migration.</p>\n\n<p>Other fields have taken concrete steps to counter similar problems. In global health, donors have funded early-career researchers and those from low-resource backgrounds in order to diversify the evidence base. Leading climate scientists have developed open-access repositories and shared training to expand participation. In education, particularly in North America and Europe, peer mentoring networks have bridged gaps between senior and early-career researchers, helping to create more inclusive knowledge communities. Migration research also has examples of these kinds of initiatives, particularly in the Global North, but they are limited in scale.</p>\n\n<p>As a result, migration research lacks the kind of consistent and field-wide support structures that have helped other domains advance. Without targeted investment in training, funding, and collaboration opportunities, the field will likely continue to reflect entrenched inequalities. That means the policies derived from it will remain incomplete, risking misalignment with the realities they aim to address.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Making Knowledge Count</strong></p>\n\n<p>Migration pressures are rising worldwide, yet research often fails to keep pace with the decisions governments must make. This is not necessarily due to a lack of expertise; thousands of scholars are working to understand the causes, consequences, and trajectories of migration across diverse settings. Instead, the problem is often that collaboration is siloed, access to data and training is uneven, and research support is unbalanced in favor of institutions and individuals with significant resources and in high-income countries. These constraints narrow the evidence base, delay the uptake of findings, and limit scholars’ ability to weigh in on urgent policy needs.</p>\n\n<p>As such, when policymakers confront fast-moving situations, they are forced to act with incomplete or outdated information, and the consequences ripple across migration systems. Integration programs may misread local needs. Legal frameworks may ignore informal pathways. And entire policy approaches may be misaligned with on-the-ground realities.</p>\n\n<p>Addressing these gaps will require more than additional research. It will require infrastructure that expands who can contribute, what evidence is available, and how easily it can be used. That means rethinking how training, collaboration, and infrastructure are distributed, and investing in an ecosystem that supports a more inclusive and diverse research community.</p>\n\n<p>One option is a new centralized platform that would enable researchers, particularly those in the Global South, to access curated, well-documented datasets, view funding opportunities, and connect with high-quality collaborators through a customized matching system. Allowing for shared discussion spaces and peer exchange could make it easier to build trust across disciplines, regions, and institutions.</p>\n\n<p>Other global research fields have built these kinds of scaffolds to make knowledge production more inclusive and usable. Migration research can do the same. But doing so will require intentional investment not only in research but also in the systems that support those who produce and apply it.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Sources</strong></p>\n\n<p>Goodman, Seth, Ariel BenYishay, Zhonghui Lv, and Daniel Runfola. 2019.

The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 lifted country quotas that had limited migration from non-European countries. The Refugee Act of 1980 increased admissions of people fleeing conflict, including sizable numbers from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, and Eritrea. And the Immigration Act of 1990 created the Diversity Visa to bolster immigration from under-represented countries, such as Cameroon and Chad. The 1990 law also made it easier for highly skilled immigrants to come for work, opening the door to many educated workers and international students from countries including Nigeria, South Africa, Kenya, and Ghana.</p>\n\n<p>The 2.5 million immigrants from sub-Saharan Africa in 2024 represented well more than triple the number present in 2000. Sub-Saharan Africans accounted for 5 percent of all 50.2 million U.S. immigrants in 2024. This highly diverse group is comprised of individuals from a range of ethnic, linguistic, and educational backgrounds. While rates differ among nationalities, immigrants from sub-Saharan Africa are generally more likely than the overall foreign-born population to have become U.S. citizens, be active in the U.S. labor force, have arrived since 2010, and have higher educational attainment.</p>\n\n<p>Whether the region’s growth trajectory continues remains to be seen. Some elements of U.S. policy under the Trump administration have generally restricted immigration from the region. The refugee resettlement program, an important pathway for many displaced people, has been largely put on hold since early 2025 and may resume in 2026 with far smaller numbers—reportedly just 7,500 places. And eight of the 19 nations included in the June 2025 travel ban are in sub-Saharan Africa, although current visa holders and others are exempt. Changes to visa reciprocity rules for people from Cameroon, Ethiopia, Ghana, and Nigeria may further limit legal arrivals.</p>\n\n<p>This Spotlight provides information on the sub-Saharan African immigrant population in the United States, focusing on its size, geographic distribution, and socioeconomic characteristics.</p>\n\n<div class=\"source-box-sidebar\">\n\t<p class=\"source-box-title\"><strong>Definitions</strong></p>\n\n\t<p>The U.S. Census Bureau defines the “<strong>foreign born</strong>” as individuals without U.S. citizenship at birth. The foreign-born population includes naturalized citizens, lawful permanent residents, refugees and asylees, legal nonimmigrants (including those on student, work, or other temporary visas), and persons residing in the country without authorization.</p>\n\n\t<p>The terms “<strong>foreign born</strong>” and “<strong>immigrant</strong>” are used interchangeably and refer to those who were born in another country and later migrated to the United States.</p>\n\n\t<p><strong>Sub-Saharan Africa</strong> is defined as all African countries except Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Morocco, Sudan, Tunisia, and the disputed Western Sahara territory.

This attitude, a booming economy, and other factors combined to make Argentina one of the world’s top immigration destinations during its early history. Between 1830 and 1950, 8.2 million European immigrants arrived in Argentina, more than any other country globally aside from the United States during this period. Furthermore, the country was the destination for 80 percent of all intra-South American migration in the 20th century.</p>\n\n<div class=\"source-box-sidebar\">\n\t<p class=\"source-box-title\">In This Article</p>\n\n\t<ul><li>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"source-box-title\"><a href=\"https://www.migrationpolicy.org#historical-trends\">Argentine elites embraced immigration—especially from Europe—in the country's early days</a></p>\n\t\t</li>\n\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"source-box-title\"><a href=\"https://www.migrationpolicy.org#latin-american-immigration\">Immigration from elsewhere in South America rose in the second half of the 20th century</a></p>\n\t\t</li>\n\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"source-box-title\"><a href=\"https://www.migrationpolicy.org#recent-shifts\">In the mid-2010s, the government shifted its approach to become more restrictive</a></p>\n\t\t</li>\n\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"source-box-title\"><a href=\"https://www.migrationpolicy.org#immigrant-population\">Immigrants account for about 4 percent of Argentina’s population, with the largest numbers coming from Paraguay and Bolivia</a></p>\n\t\t</li>\n\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"source-box-title\"><a href=\"https://www.migrationpolicy.org#emigration\">Military rule contributed to emigration in the 20th century, leading to sizable diasporas in Spain, the United States, and Italy</a></p>\n\t\t</li>\n\t</ul></div>\n\n<p>Immigration peaked in the early 20th century when the foreign born accounted for approximately 30 percent of Argentina’s population; it has fallen sharply since then. The country’s approach to migration policy has evolved in complex ways and has come to involve greater integration with neighbors, including allowing free movement. However, over the last decade, policies have turned much more restrictive, as leaders have sought to limit immigrants’ access to permanent residency and citizenship.</p>\n\n<p>In 2022, close to 2 million immigrants lived in Argentina, comprising just over 4 percent of the total population and making the country the second largest immigrant destination in Latin America, after Colombia (home to about 3.1 million immigrants, according to mid-2024 UN Population Division estimates). The largest numbers of foreign born are from Paraguay, followed by Bolivia, Venezuela, and Peru. Meanwhile, a combination of 20th-century military governments and repeated economic crises have contributed to the emigration of Argentines to Spain, the United States, Italy, and other destinations.</p>\n\n<p>This country profile examines Argentina’s migration past and present, focusing on major immigration policies and trends. It offers information on the historical belief that immigration from Europe was the pathway to development, rising immigration from elsewhere in Latin America in the latter half of the 20th century, and increasing restrictions in recent years, among other dynamics.</p>\n\n<p><strong><a id=\"historical-trends\" name=\"historical-trends\"></a>Historical Immigration Trends</strong></p>\n\n<p>Soon after the country’s independence in 1816, Argentine elites embraced immigration. Prominent early political leaders Juan Bautista Alberdi and President Domingo Faustino Sarmiento (in office from 1868 to 1874) thought immigration would be a solution for Argentina’s small population—which stood at roughly 500,000 in the first part of the century—and Europeanize its local culture. They sought to encourage arrivals from Europe, and particularly Northern Europe.</p>\n\n<p>Alberdi coined the phrase “to govern is to populate” (“<em>gobernar es poblar</em>”) to indicate that immigration should be the main instrument for Argentina’s modernization. He thought education should play a major role but was not sufficient on its own; even if one makes the “<em>gaucho</em>, the <em>cholo</em>, [and a] fundamental share of our popular masses go through the transformation of the best education system, not even in a hundred years [will you] get an English worker,” he claimed in his writing, using a derogatory term to refer to rural and Indigenous people. Alberdi believed that immigrants from Europe would educate the local population through their work habits.</p>\n\n<p>The 1853 Constitution, drafted by Alberdi, reflected this eagerness. It established a representative and federal republic and contained several immigration provisions. The preamble invited immigration of all “good-willed citizens of the world,” and the Bill of Rights granted equal rights for all inhabitants—not just citizens. Moreover, Article 25, which is still in effect today, stated that the “federal government will encourage European immigration and may not restrict, limit, or burden with any tax whatsoever, the entry into the Argentine territory of foreigners who arrive for the purpose of tilling the soil, improving industries, and introducing and teaching arts and sciences.”</p>\n\n<p>To attract these immigrants, Congress passed the Avellaneda Law in 1876, creating immigration offices in Europe, subsidizing transportation to Argentina and land in the country, and offering immigrants temporary lodging and free transport inland upon arrival. According to this law, any individual who could prove their aptitude to develop an industry, art, or otherwise useful occupation could immigrate to Argentina. After 1881, immigration increased rapidly (see Figure 1). Immigrants’ share of the population rose from 12 percent in 1869 to 30 percent nationwide in 1914 and 50 percent in Buenos Aires. From 1870 to 1914, 5.9 million immigrants arrived in Argentina, and more than half of them settled permanently.</p>\n\n<div class=\"source-box-figure\">\n\t<p class=\"source-box-title\"><strong>Figure 1.

Most immigrants came from Italy and Spain, with other notable origins including Uruguay, Chile, Russia, and the Ottoman Empire (see Figure 2). Several factors explain why Argentina attracted so many of these immigrants in the 19th and early 20th centuries, including its open policies, economic success, and world events. Among them was Argentina’s status as a top agricultural exporter at the turn of the 20th century, which made it an attractive option in the Americas.</p>\n\n<div class=\"source-box-figure\">\n\t<p class=\"source-box-title\"><strong>Figure 2.

While 57 percent of immigrants in 1914 worked in agricultural sectors such as cattle ranching and grain production, the government’s system of allocating land was ineffective, and large numbers of immigrants ended up settling in big urban centers. In 1895, migrants owned 80 percent of Buenos Aires’s industrial and commercial establishments.</p>\n\n<p>With the rise of industrialization, not everyone was benefiting at the same pace. Sixty percent of immigrants and a large portion of the native population lived in poverty and were often subjected to exploitative working conditions. The urban working classes, vulnerable to the cycles of an economy that heavily depended on foreign investment and imports, gradually began to organize into labor unions. Like in other countries, as labor unrest spread, elites often scapegoated immigrants and restricted the entry of people with leftist ideologies.</p>\n\n<p>Other selective immigration policies were also linked to changing social and economic conditions. As poverty and crime increased in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the government restricted immigration of the indigent, people likely to become a public charge, and criminals.</p>\n\n<p>Global trends also affected who came to Argentina. The Spanish Civil War, the World Wars, and the Holocaust would play a role in driving European emigration, for which Argentina was well positioned to benefit. Immigration in the 20th century increased from places other than Romance-language European countries, including refugees fleeing Nazism and people from Argentina’s neighboring countries, although the foreign-born population never surpassed the 1914 peak of 2.4 million. In the 1920s, Poles and other Central Europeans were the third largest group of new arrivals, after Spaniards and Italians. Before the outbreak of the World War II, many Jewish and other persecuted people arrived in Argentina, although the country later imposed bureaucratic obstacles for future Jewish refugees.</p>\n\n<p>Indeed, World War II dampened multiple types of immigration, especially in combination with 1938 legislation that required immigrants to have a permit to land (<em>permiso de desembarco</em>) from Argentine consulates in their country of origin, which were available only after completing extensive paperwork. The permit had to be approved in Argentina by a committee composed of members of the Ministries of Interior, Foreign Relations, and Agriculture. The Ministry of Foreign Relations, in principle, was reluctant to accept refugees. In practice, however, it signed agreements with several private companies and organizations to form agricultural colonies (some of which were suspected of corrupt practices), including with the Jewish Colonization Association. Despite the numerous obstacles to settlement of Jewish refugees, some 22,500 entered the country.</p>\n\n<p><strong><a id=\"latin-american-immigration\" name=\"latin-american-immigration\"></a>Latin American Immigration and Law 25,871</strong></p>\n\n<p>Immigration from Argentina’s neighbors—Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Paraguay, and Uruguay—rose rapidly beginning in the mid-20th century. Whereas 43,000 immigrants from these countries lived in Argentina in 1869, the number increased to 330,000 in 1947. They would continue to grow in number: While migrants from the surrounding region represented less than 9 percent of Argentina’s foreign-born population in 1914, by 2022, they accounted for two-thirds (see Figure 3). For years, migrants from neighboring countries were recruited at the border by contractors and entered without much scrutiny.</p>\n\n<div class=\"source-box-figure\">\n\t<p class=\"source-box-title\"><strong>Figure 3.

Strict rules for admission resulted in large numbers of Latin American immigrants without legal status. Democratic governments sporadically regularized the status of many of these immigrants, often in the direct aftermath of periods of military rule; amnesty decrees were issued in 1958, 1964, 1974, and 1983. Additional regularizations were offered after full democratization in 1983, with decrees issued in 1992, 2004 (more on this below), and 2005.</p>\n\n<p>In 2002, Member States of the Southern Common Market (MERCOSUR)—a free-trade agreement originally signed by Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay, and Paraguay in 1991, which Venezuela and Bolivia later joined (although Venezuelan membership has since been suspended)—announced they would allow for free movement within the bloc. The following year, Argentina’s Congress passed Law 25,871, which has been characterized as one of the world’s most progressive immigration policies and marked a historic change for the country. Importantly, this law recognized the human right to migrate (in Article 4) and, departing from a long tradition of prioritizing European immigration, authorized citizens of MERCOSUR Member States plus Chileans to live and work freely in Argentina. In addition, the law codified rights in both Argentina’s Bill of Rights and international agreements; regardless of immigration status, individuals have the right to education (Article 7), health and social services (Article 8), family reunification (Article 10), and to vote in local elections (Article 11). The law also established that the government facilitates immigrants’ integration (Article 14) and regularizes their immigration status (Article 15). Finally, this law regulates deportation and grants the right to judicial review (Article 61).</p>\n\n<p>Law 25,871 also established the various routes for immigrants to obtain permanent, temporary, or transitory residence. Generally speaking, the only foreign nationals eligible for permanent residence are relatives of Argentine citizens. Several other categories of immigrants can apply for temporary residency, including those who come to work for an employer, retirees, investors, scientists and skilled workers, athletes, and official representatives of religions. Finally, tourists, people in transit, and seasonal workers can apply for what the law describes as transitory residency.</p>\n\n<p>In 2004, shortly after the passage of Law 25,871, Decree 836/2004 and Decree 1169/2004 allowed for the regularization of immigrants already residing in Argentina from non-MERCOSUR Member States and from nations in the bloc, respectively. Decree 836/2004 proved legal status to about 12,000 people, most of whom were Chinese, Korean, Colombian, or Dominican. Decree 1169/2004, known as <em>Patria Grande </em>(Big Fatherland), regularized close to 424,000 individuals, most of whom were Paraguayan, Bolivian, or Peruvian. Unlike the regularizations that had been common during intermittent democratic governments, these decrees allowed immigrants to become permanent residents.</p>\n\n<p>The drivers of this Latin American immigration have varied. Certain Argentine economic sectors have been a lure for South Americans for almost a century, including sugar mills and tobacco plantations in the northwest, which attracted many Bolivians; cotton, yerba mate, and tea production in the northeast, which drew significant numbers of Paraguayans; and Patagonia’s horticulture, wine, coal and oil, construction, and cattle industries, which have brought in sizable numbers of Chileans. Industrialization in the 20th century increasingly pulled Latin American immigrants to big cities. In more recent years, Argentina has also been host to many Venezuelans who fled their country during the economic and political crises that accompanied the administrations of Presidents Hugo Chávez and Nicolás Maduro. Approximately 171,000 Venezuelans lived in Argentina as of mid-2025, a sizable number but still a fraction of all 7.7 million Venezuelans displaced since 2014.</p>\n\n<p><strong><a id=\"recent-shifts\" name=\"recent-shifts\"></a>Recent Policy Shifts and Current Discussions</strong></p>\n\n<p>Center-right coalition leader Mauricio Macri became Argentina’s president in 2015, as the country faced high inflation, economic stagnation, fiscal deficits, and depressed foreign trade, along with the elevated crime that was common in parts of Latin America. Amid these changes, the government shifted its approach to become more restrictive. Macri declared a state of emergency to address organized crime and drug trafficking. The government also cut resources facilitating the regularization of unauthorized immigrants and opened an immigration detention center in Buenos Aires.</p>\n\n<p>In 2017, Macri issued Decree 70/2017 to create several new categories of inadmissibility, allow for expedited removals, and modify Argentina’s nationality law. The following year, a federal court ruled some provisions were in violation of Argentina’s Constitution. For instance, Law 25,871 established that an immigrant convicted of certain crimes is not eligible for residency in Argentina, but Macri’s decree sought to expand that bar to foreign nationals who were indicted or had only “participated” (the word was left undefined) in certain crimes—effectively meaning the mere accusation or suspicion of having participated in a crime could permanently prevent a person from immigrating. The decree also sought to expand the scope of who could be deported, making eligible for removal noncitizens convicted of a long list of lower-level crimes as well as those who were indicted or deemed to have merely “participated” in certain crimes. Decree 70/2017 also sought to establish an expedited removal process (<em>proceso sumarísmo</em>) that modified provisions of Law 25,871 to make fewer deportation decisions subject to judicial review and shortened deadlines for appealing removal decisions to just three days, a demand which many immigrants were unable to meet. The decree was ultimately repealed in 2021 by the government of President Alberto Fernández.</p>\n\n<p><em>Milei’s Order:</em> <em>Who Is Welcome in Argentina?</em></p>\n\n<p>Right-wing libertarian President Javier Milei was elected in 2023. In May 2025, his government issued Decree 366/2025, making sweeping changes to citizenship and residency requirements, deportation rules, and access to public services. These changes mirrored those introduced by Macri’s Decree 70/2017 several years earlier. Decree 366/2025 restricts permanent residency to the children of Argentine citizens. It made several changes to the naturalization process that have since been ruled unconstitutional, including demanding that immigrants have two uninterrupted years of continued legal residency in Argentina before they could become citizens, a change that would have forbidden interested applicants from ever leaving the country, which could have posed problems for many residents needing to visit their origin countries. The decree also sought to change jurisdiction over the Nationality Act from the courts to the National Directorate for Migration and extend the right to naturalization to any foreign-born person who made an “investment relevant to the country,” regardless of the duration of their residence in Argentina; both changes were later ruled unconstitutional.</p>\n\n<p>The decree also expanded the list of violations rendering immigrants deportable, restricted the right to judicial review, and, as with Macri’s decree in 2017, established a process for expedited removals. Decree 366/2025 expanded the list of categories meriting deportation to include, among others, crimes punished with a prison sentence of under three years and violations of immigration law. It also expedited the removal process. The government has widely advertised a regulation preventing known criminals from being admitted to Argentina, yet previous laws (including Law 25,871) forbade persons convicted of certain crimes from being granted residency.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, in line with political discourses in places such as Europe and the United States, Milei has stated that Argentina’s welfare state is a magnet for “undesirable” and “unnecessary” immigrants, and so has sought to eliminate access to benefits in order to reduce migration incentives. As such, while Argentina’s public health-care system has for many decades been open to all persons regardless of immigration status, Decree 366/2025 limited access to citizens and permanent residents; other lawfully present immigrants can access public health care only in emergencies. This limitation represents a departure from legislation passed by Argentina’s Congress, which grants access to health care to all persons regardless of status, and would seem to contradict the constitution’s equal rights clause for all inhabitants.</p>\n\n<p>Decree 366/2025 also limited access to free public higher education to citizens and permanent residents, modifying legislation approved by Congress granting education—including at the college level—to all immigrants, regardless of status. Professionals from all over Latin American have attended Argentina’s higher education institutions for many decades, making the country an education hub in Latin America.</p>\n\n<p><em>Bypassing Congress to Set Policy </em></p>\n\n<p>The immigration changes made by Milei and Macri were approved by necessity and urgency decrees (<em>decreto de necesidad y urgencia</em>, or DNU), a type of order outlined in Argentina’s Constitution allowing the executive to pass laws in exceptional circumstances when consultations with Congress may not be feasible. These decrees have traditionally been used for economic policy. They must be signed by the entire presidential cabinet and are subject to congressional oversight.</p>\n\n<p>No clear exceptional circumstance was at stake when Macri and Milei used this tool to change immigration policy. Critics have opposed these practices, on the grounds that the issues were not urgent and merit both congressional and social debate.</p>\n\n<p><strong><a id=\"immigrant-population\" name=\"immigrant-population\"></a>Current Immigrant Population: Numbers and Origins</strong></p>\n\n<p>In 2022, the year of the most recent national census, close to 2 million foreign-born individuals lived in Argentina, representing 4.2 percent of the total population. Both the foreign born’s share of the population and the overall number of immigrants has declined over the last century; in 1914, immigrants accounted for nearly 30 percent of Argentina’s residents (see Figure 4).</p>\n\n<div class=\"source-box-figure\">\n\t<p class=\"source-box-title\"><strong>Figure 4.

Nearly 8,400 refugees arrived from 2000 to 2024, largely Venezuelans (42 percent), followed by Russians (32 percent), Cubans (5 percent), Brazilians and Colombians (just under 3 percent each), and Syrians (2 percent). The definition of refugee in the General Law for the Recognition and Protection of Refugees (Law 26,165) from 2006 is consistent with that of the 1951 Refugee Convention: individuals with reason to fear persecution on the basis of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. Argentina has not adopted the more expansive approach to protection outlined in the 1984 Cartagena Declaration on Refugees, which several other Latin American countries have signed.</p>\n\n<div class=\"source-box-figure\">\n\t<p class=\"source-box-title\"><strong>Figure 6.

Repressive military governments contributed to this emigration, though better work conditions and living standards abroad played a role as well. Common destinations for emigrants during the 1950s and 1960s included the United States, Western Europe, Israel, Mexico, and Venezuela.</p>\n\n<p>Large numbers also moved abroad after Argentina’s 2001 economic collapse. Spanish and Italian rules offering citizenship to descendants of their nationals likely contributed to making these two of the top destinations for Argentines abroad, home to 391,000 and 89,000 Argentina-born migrants, respectively, as of mid-2024, according to UN Population Division estimates. Approximately 216,000 Argentine emigrants had also settled in the United States as of 2023, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Issues on the Horizon: The Future of Restrictions</strong></p>\n\n<p>Milei’s immigration rules represent a major departure for Argentina’s health and education systems. A November 2024 poll from Zuban Córdoba and Associates showed that Argentines already generally trust these public systems: While public trust in other institutions was low, 71 percent of respondents said they trusted the public health system and 72 percent trusted public universities.</p>\n\n<p>Milei’s changes to immigration legislation through necessity and urgency decrees will be reviewed by Congress, which could walk back some measures. His party has relied on political alliances to advance his agenda; there are signs that its support is slipping. In August 2025, Congress invalidated several necessity and urgency decrees related to government cuts. While it has not weighed it on Decree 366/2025 as of this writing, it seems unlikely that Congress will support the decree. A federal court in August 2025 decided that Decree 366/2025’s rules on naturalization are unconstitutional; while this decision represents just one blow against the changes, it could point to broader legal challenges for the measure.</p>\n\n<p>Yet even if Congress walks back some of these more recent changes, it is clear that Argentina has entered a new migration era. Amid a range of economic and other challenges, the country has embraced more restrictions while also integrating with fellow MERCOSUR Member States. Although immigration from Europe is no longer a central policy goal, the government remains focused on selective types of immigrants and has built up obstacles for others.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Sources</strong></p>\n\n<p>Albarracín, Julia. 2020. <em>Making Immigrants in Modern Argentina</em>.

After years of unprecedented human mobility since 2010, during which time the number of migrants in the region roughly doubled, migration has become unpredictable, multidirectional, and increasingly difficult for governments to manage. Countries have simultaneously grappled with the integration of displaced people (primarily Venezuelans, Haitians, Nicaraguans, and Cubans), secondary migration as individuals moved on when opportunities faltered, circular and return migration, and emigration of frustrated middle classes.</p>\n\n<p>The region was able to navigate the first mass arrivals, which largely began in the early and mid-2010s, thanks to solidarity-driven responses. Governments, especially but not exclusively those in South America, took bold steps to open temporary legal pathways and grant protection to millions of Venezuelans and others, enabling them to rapidly enter the labor market and obtain regular status. These policies were significant accomplishments, demonstrating remarkable pragmatism, but were often not anchored in strong institutions. Temporary permits have often expired without offering individuals a path to permanence, migrants have struggled to access education and health systems, and integration has remained uneven. These weaknesses are now helping fuel the growing unpredictability in policy decision-making. And today, South American governments that once leaned heavily into regularizing newcomers have discontinued many of these programs for recent arrivals and failed to link them with long-term integration for those who have been in the country for years.</p>\n\n<div class=\"source-box-sidebar\">\n\t<p class=\"source-box-title\">In This Article</p>\n\n\t<ul><li>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"source-box-title\"><a href=\"https://www.migrationpolicy.org#south-america\">The stage for an ambitious solidarity experiment, South America is now facing policy strains and new uncertainty</a></p>\n\t\t</li>\n\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"source-box-title\"><a href=\"https://www.migrationpolicy.org#central-america-mexico\">In Mexico and Central America, governments have balanced desires to assist newly arriving migrants and control their onward movement</a></p>\n\t\t</li>\n\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"source-box-title\"><a href=\"https://www.migrationpolicy.org#caribbean\">Caribbean countries have increased regional integration, but mostly without addressing displacement from Haiti</a></p>\n\t\t</li>\n\t</ul></div>\n\n<p>The prospect of mass deportations from the United States threatens to magnify the vulnerabilities of integration systems in Latin American and Caribbean countries. If past is prologue—and fully 87 percent of all U.S. interior removals during fiscal years (FY) 2021-24 were to Mexico and northern Central America—the sharp rise in immigration enforcement in U.S. communities may result in a significantly greater number of returnees to the region in the months and years ahead. These governments have long-established reception and reintegration programs to assist returnees, but any sudden or large returns of their nationals may overwhelm their uneven capacities, especially as they manage other migration pressures. And while mass deportations to Haiti are not yet feasible due to the country’s difficult conditions, President Donald Trump’s administration has sought to end temporary protections for hundreds of thousands of Haitians, making them subject to removal and increasing the risk of further destabilizing the Caribbean.   </p>\n\n<p>This dual reality—solidarity that achieved short-term successes but left in place fragile systems that are now facing mounting pressures—frames the broader story of migration across Latin America and the Caribbean.</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, regional efforts at cooperation that had blossomed in recent years are increasingly being overshadowed by uneven bilateral, deportation-focused negotiations between the United States and individual countries. Central America and Mexico have become reluctant destinations, caught between the twin pressures of managing return and reintegration of their own nationals as well as third-country nationals under U.S.-driven arrangements. For countries such as El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua—where remittances from abroad account for roughly one-fifth to more than one-quarter of the economy—large-scale returns could shake the very foundations of their economies.</p>\n\n<p>And in the Caribbean, regional frameworks to enhance free mobility have advanced in meaningful ways, but often by leaving Haiti, the subregion’s largest origin country for migrants, on the margins. Key countries hosting Haitian migrants are either reluctant to implement their commitments, under the guise of national security concerns, or remain outside regional migration policy discussions altogether.</p>\n\n<p>Taken together, these experiences reveal both the possibilities and the limitations of migration governance in a region confronting an unpredictable new era.</p>\n\n<p>This article traces these dynamics across the Caribbean and Central and South America and examines the likelihood of a tipping point in regional migration management. It is based in part on research conducted for the authors’ book, <em>On the Move: Migration Policies in Latin America and the Caribbean</em> (Stanford University Press, August 2025).</p>\n\n<p><strong><a id=\"south-america\" name=\"south-america\"></a>South America’s Migration Experiment After a Decade of Solidarity</strong></p>\n\n<p>Faced with the sudden displacement of more than 7.7 million Venezuelans since 2014, about 90 percent of whom remained in the region, South America became the stage for one of the most ambitious solidarity experiments in modern migration history. Governments moved quickly to open their doors to many of these individuals. The largest numbers of displaced Venezuelans at this writing were in Colombia (nearly 2.8 million) and Peru (1.7 million; see Figure 1). In several countries, Venezuelans were joining Haitians who had arrived in significant numbers after a 2010 earthquake ravaged their country.</p>\n\n<div class=\"source-box-figure\">\n\t<p class=\"source-box-title\"><strong>Figure 1. Venezuelan Migrants in South America, 2025</strong></p>\n\t<img alt=\"\" height=\"694\" src=\"https://www.migrationpolicy.org/sites/default/files/source_charts/fe-2025-laci-fig1-SAmerica.png\" style=\"width: 710px; height: 694px;\" width=\"710\" /><p class=\"source-box-sources\"><em>Note</em>: Not shown are countries hosting fewer than 100,000 Venezelan migrants.<br /><em>Source</em>: Inter-Agency Coordination Platform for Refugees and Migrants (R4V), <em>May 2025: Venezuelan Refugees and Migrants</em> (N.p.: R4V, 2025), <a href=\"https://reliefweb.int/report/colombia/venezuelan-refugees-and-migrants-region-may-2025\" target=\"_blank\">available online</a>.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>Early responses were both pragmatic and far-reaching. Colombia granted first two and then ten years of temporary legal status, ultimately covering more than 2.5 million Venezuelans. A similar program in Peru covered about 500,000 individuals. Brazil created humanitarian visas that allowed for a rapid transition to permanent residence. These measures enabled millions to rapidly enter labor markets and access services, easing humanitarian pressure. Argentina and Uruguay used regional mobility agreements to grant legal status to Venezuelans, while Chile and Ecuador used flexibility in their visa systems to provide status to many recent arrivals. The policies were made possible by (in most cases) a shared language and history, as well as high levels of economic informality that made it easy for newcomers to find work, and a powerful solidarity narrative, given that many South Americans had in the past sought shelter in Venezuela during their countries’ own conflicts and crises.</p>\n\n<p>But these same policies also exposed institutional fragility. Permits were often temporary, data systems meant to connect migrants with essential services and align government needs with available human capital remained fragmented, and access to social services lagged. Colombia’s Temporary Statute of Protection for Venezuelans (<em>Estatuto Temporal de Protección para Migrantes Venezolanos</em>, or ETPV) was suspended for new registrants in 2024 and replaced with a much more restricted program for minors and their legal guardians, known as PEP Tutor. In Peru and Ecuador, new elected leaders have repeatedly altered requirements for residency. The rapid policy changes eroded trust among migrants as well as employers and local communities. Private firms had invested in formalizing migrant workers, but sometimes lost confidence as policies shifted and workers slipped back into irregularity. Rights granted on paper lacked full connection to health, education, and social protection systems.</p>\n\n<p>What the last decade has shown is that integration challenges are rarely limited to one country. As rules changed and opportunities evaporated, many migrants moved again—often through the Darien jungle leading to Central America and points north (more on this below)—placing pressure on other countries.</p>\n\n<p><em>Challenges—and Opportunity—in Unsettled Times </em></p>\n\n<p>These policy weaknesses are now magnified by uncertainty on multiple fronts. Governments face the unfinished task of integrating millions already present while also managing new outflows. Nearly 1 million Colombians left their country from 2022 through 2023, and 400,000 Ecuadorians have emigrated since 2021. This movement reflects widespread disenchantment with limited opportunities and rising security challenges, as well as the lure of the United States. At the same time, a new cohort of arrivals may be forthcoming, in the form of deportees from United States who will need integration assistance of their own.</p>\n\n<p>Politics add another layer of instability. In Chile, for example, rising homicide rates have become an electoral flashpoint, with a major focus being Venezuelan gangs that arrived initially to extort migrants but quickly took over parts of the local crime scene. Ahead of November 2025 elections, candidates have responded with immigration-focused proposals to militarize enforcement or increase surveillance of the foreign born. Upcoming elections in Colombia, Brazil, and elsewhere across the region might lead to further policy churn.</p>\n\n<p>However, within this unpredictability lies opportunity. As in other parts of the region, increasing remittances are reshaping South American societies, yet policies have so far treated these money transfers and other migration trends as short-term issues rather than part of a broader development strategy. Linking these changes to labor-market and other reforms could allow governments to turn both their immigrant and emigrant populations into economic and social catalysts. South America has already shown that solidarity, including in the form of regular status, can offer millions of immigrants a stake in their host societies. The challenge now is to build on that success and learn from past mistakes.</p>\n\n<p><strong><a id=\"central-america-mexico\" name=\"central-america-mexico\"></a>Central America and Mexico Evolve into Destinations</strong></p>\n\n<p>There is a long history of Mexican migration to the United States, going back to the 19th century, with Central American migration picking up in the 1980s. These patterns, too, changed dramatically in the 2010s. First, there was a rapid increase in Central Americans heading to the United States, which became particularly visible in 2014 with significant arrivals of unaccompanied minors from El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras. Facing U.S. border restrictions, many migrants began to stay temporarily in Mexico, making it a major destination country for the first time in recent history. Then in 2018, the Nicaraguan government cracked down on opposition protests, sending upwards of 300,000 Nicaraguans into neighboring Costa Rica, which was already hosting a smaller but significant number of displaced Colombians and Venezuelans.</p>\n\n<p>The Mexican and Costa Rican governments responded, in part, by strengthening their asylum systems to provide people fleeing danger a chance to stay legally. But Mexico in particular also began to face pressure from the U.S. government to do more to control its border with Guatemala. This pressure increased after the easing of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2021, when large numbers of Central Americans, South Americans, Haitians, and others began traversing the remote Darien Gap straddling Colombia and Panama, often bound for the United States (see Figure 2). Indeed, every country in Central America to some degree found itself caught between a desire to help and pressure to control the flow of migrants now appearing or passing through. In the case of Panama and Mexico, escalating U.S. pressure became particularly significant to try to reduce the incentives for onward movement.</p>\n\n<div class=\"source-box-figure\">\n\t<p class=\"source-box-title\"><strong>Figure 2.

At the same time, the governments have also developed greater capacity to deter migrants from journeying farther north. The Mexican government, in particular, significantly ramped up efforts to detain and deport irregular migrants, such as by allowing the National Guard to assist with immigration enforcement. From May 2024 through March 2025, Mexican authorities interdicted more migrants on their territory each month than did U.S. Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) at the U.S.-Mexico border.</p>\n\n<p>In June 2024, the Biden administration further limited access to asylum at the U.S. border, where it had witnessed two years of all-time high encounters of people crossing without authorization, leading to a steady decline in northbound migration. With Trump’s inauguration in January 2025 and the imposition of a campaign of “shock and awe” to tackle unauthorized migration, numbers dropped even further.</p>\n\n<p>Today, Mexican and Central American leaders are more concerned about their own citizens likely to be deported; more than two-thirds of the 13.7 million unauthorized immigrants in the United States as of mid-2023 came from these countries, according to Migration Policy Institute (MPI) estimates. Most countries have made some provisions to receive and provide basic services to returnees, and some are beginning to see returning migrants as potential human capital with skills that can contribute to the local economy. Leaders are also looking to a future in which fewer remittances are sent from abroad, which would have a direct impact on local economies. Any such disruption would likely reverberate through households and national accounts alike.</p>\n\n<div class=\"source-box-sidebar\">\n\t<p class=\"source-box-title\"><strong>Box 1.

Since 2011, nationals of countries in the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS)—Antigua and Barbuda, Dominica, Grenada, Montserrat, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines—have been able to travel, work, and reside freely and indefinitely in each other’s nations without much bureaucracy.</p>\n\n<p>The desire for integration comes in part from the Caribbean’s position as a transit point for global trade. An ideal climate and beautiful beaches attract international tourists year-round. But countries have struggled to retain workers amid labor shortages and aging societies. Countries such as Barbados and Jamaica have experienced decades of emigration, particularly of teachers and nurses, and yet their own growing labor needs mean they rely on foreign workers. Faced with this reality amid a recent oil boom, Guyana’s immigration policies have become more flexible, to increase recruiting of diaspora members and other Caribbean nationals.</p>\n\n<p>Yet the subregion’s topography also exposes it to natural disasters and related displacement, as seen after a 2010 earthquake in Haiti, Hurricane Maria’s 2017 devastation of Dominica, and last year’s Hurricane Beryl that decimated parts of Grenada and St. Vincent and the Grenadines. In instances such as these, the Dominican Republic has temporarily relaxed immigration policies, but many people have also benefitted from pre-existing labor mobility agreements in the Eastern Caribbean. Moreover, the subregion’s location and the fact that many countries are archipelagos, with multiple difficult-to-monitor entry points, makes them ripe for the smuggling of drugs and humans, and as such has led to security concerns.</p>\n\n<p>Seldom discussed is migration to the multiple Caribbean territories of France, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Higher-paying jobs in the hospitality and tourism industry and a potential gateway to advanced economies in North America and Europe attract workers from everywhere. Citizens of the Dominican Republic, for instance, account for sizable shares of the populations of Anguilla and Turks and Caicos (British Overseas Territories), Curaçao and St. Maarten (which are Dutch), and Puerto Rico (a U.S. territory). Many of these territories have small and, in some cases, declining native-born populations, are highly dependent on migrant labor, and lack autonomy over their immigration policy.</p>\n\n<p>And while there is little immigration to Cuba, several cooperation agreements involve the movement of Cuban health professionals to other Caribbean nations. More generally, Cuba has recently experienced the largest emigration in its modern history, due to an economic downturn and political discontent, particularly among younger generations. But whereas most Cuban migrants once headed to the United States, they are now moving to other countries in Latin America and the Caribbean.</p>\n\n<p><em>Humanitarian Needs and Haiti’s Collapse</em></p>\n\n<p>The region has had to contend with migrants with humanitarian needs, mostly Haitians and Venezuelans, as well as smaller numbers of Cubans and Africans. Unlike South America, which strove to build immigration systems that could withstand and integrate displaced people, governments in the Caribbean have focused on economic growth and development. Policies targeted at humanitarian migrants, such as Trinidad and Tobago’s approach to Venezuelan arrivals, were modeled as emergency responses. One exception has been Belize’s 2021 regularization program, which primarily affected Central Americans.</p>\n\n<p>Haiti’s spiraling security and economic crisis, which has prompted hundreds of thousands of people to leave especially for the neighboring Dominican Republic to varying degrees since 2010, is conspicuously absent from regional conversations. Low economic development and deep political instability in Haiti since the 2021 assassination of President Jovenel Moïse have hardened Dominican leaders’ position towards Haitians. They have focused on stopping Haitians from coming, building a border wall, and conducting mass deportations, including 276,000 repatriations to Haiti in 2024. Dominican leaders have considered regularizing some Haitian workers, but immigration policies remain primarily restrictive.</p>\n\n<p>Haiti’s socioeconomic turmoil has slowed the implementation of its own commitments towards CARICOM. And though the bloc-wide full free mobility is expected to eventually include Haiti, implementation is unlikely until the country’s political and security concerns are addressed. In fact, CARICOM’s repeated calls for solidarity with the Haitian people and regional negotiators’ role helping address Haiti’s political impasse are a recognition of the need for a collective and durable solution.</p>\n\n<p><strong><a id=\"tipping-point\" name=\"tipping-point\"></a>A Tipping Point</strong></p>\n\n<p>Latin America and the Caribbean are at a tipping point in their approach to migration. The last decade demonstrated that solidarity could be translated into large-scale regularization, providing millions of Venezuelans with temporary legal status and opportunities for inclusion. But it also revealed how fragile those gains were when not anchored in strong institutions or long-term development agendas. As South America’s experience shows, discontinuity, weak integration, and political shifts can erode trust and cause pressures for new migration. The lesson is clear: Integration matters for stability both at home and across the hemisphere.</p>\n\n<p>This dynamic is not confined to the South. Across Central America and Mexico, governments have been pressed to manage return and reintegration of their nationals while also serving as destinations and transit countries. The Caribbean has doubled down on multiple regional migration frameworks but they are unevenly implemented and persistently exclude Haiti. Each subregion is grappling with overlapping challenges—often in silos, disconnected from one another and from national development strategies.</p>\n\n<p>Policy discontinuity also defines the political moment. Recent and upcoming elections in Ecuador, Bolivia, Chile, Honduras, Costa Rica, Colombia, Peru, and Brazil make migration policy vulnerable to abrupt shifts. Migration had previously not been politicized in most countries in the region, aside from the Dominican Republic, but it is now taking center stage in Chile and could well become an issue in other countries. In addition, new administrations across many Latin American countries have been tempted to reset their national agendas rather than build on what came before, reinforcing discontinuity.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, an element of volatility has been introduced in the international funding arena, especially for integration programs. Financing was already waning before 2025, but the Trump administration’s closure of most U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) programs and reductions in State Department funding have further diminished resources for governments in the region. These aid cuts could prove to be counterproductive, as they were often the primary funding of programs to reduce the drivers of irregular migration as well as receive and reintegrate returnees.</p>\n\n<p>Still, regional cooperation may be central to the future. The landmark 2022 Los Angeles Declaration on Migration and Protection signed by 22 countries in the region provided a common framework for migration discussions across the hemisphere. The Trump administration has withdrawn from the process initiated by the predecessor Biden administration, and this element of regional cooperation has since foundered. Other regional forums—such as the South American Migration Conference and the Quito Process (for Venezuelan displacement)—continue to operate but with limited budgets and low political visibility. Even so, they remain critical for sustaining dialogue, avoiding duplication, and keeping alive the possibility of collective approaches in a region where migration pressures are shared.</p>\n\n<p>Parts of the region have proven that solidarity can be possible despite political and institutional differences across Latin America and the Caribbean. Countries’ next moves will define not only the future of migration governance but also the region’s stability and competitiveness in the decades ahead.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Sources</strong></p>\n\n<p>Chaves-González, Diego, Jordi Amaral, and María Jesús Mora. 2021. <em>Socioeconomic Integration of Venezuelan Migrants and Refugees: The Cases of Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru</em>.

This transforms what previously had been a more limited authority for recent arrivals at the border into a far-reaching and potent deportations tool.</p>\n\n<p>The process, known as expedited removal, historically had applied primarily to unauthorized immigrants who had just arrived across a U.S. land or sea border. The administration has sought to expand use of the fast-track authority nationwide, has reportedly used it to order removals of longtime U.S. residents, and has orchestrated maneuvers to use it on individuals previously covered by various temporary protections as well as those with asylum cases pending at immigration courts and asylum offices.</p>\n\n<div class=\"source-box-sidebar\">\n\t<p class=\"source-box-title\">In This Article</p>\n\n\t<ul><li>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"source-box-title\"><a href=\"https://www.migrationpolicy.org#expansion\">Expedited removal has been used in some form for nearly 30 years, but never as expansively as the Trump administration has sought to do</a></p>\n\t\t</li>\n\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"source-box-title\"><a href=\"https://www.migrationpolicy.org#benefits-for-trump\">The process is much faster than typical removal proceedings in immigration court, which take two years on average</a></p>\n\t\t</li>\n\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"source-box-title\"><a href=\"https://www.migrationpolicy.org#expanded-net\">Among those potentially now eligible for expedited removal are a combined 2.5 million individuals released into the United States on humanitarian parole or via other means </a></p>\n\t\t</li>\n\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"source-box-title\"><a href=\"https://www.migrationpolicy.org#court-challenges\">Litigants and federal judges have jumped into the fray</a></p>\n\t\t</li>\n\t</ul></div>\n\n<p>The expansion of expedited removal, which is being challenged in court, offers the administration a major tool to meet its goal of 1 million deportations annually as well as reduce the backlog of almost 4 million removal cases pending in immigration court.</p>\n\n<p>Under the administration’s expanded vision, the powers could, in theory, be applied to at least 2.5 million noncitizens, according to Migration Policy Institute (MPI) estimates. This includes approximately 1 million migrants who arrived at the southwest border without authorization and were allowed into the United States during the second half of the Biden administration, as well as 1.5 million noncitizens previously granted temporary protections such as humanitarian parole, whom the Trump administration argues are now eligible for expedited removal. The MPI estimates cannot model the entire number of noncitizens who may be subject to expedited removal, for example the population of those who evaded arrest after crossing the border without authorization.</p>\n\n<p>The Trump administration has vigorously justified the expanded use of fast-track removal authority as a much-needed policy to reverse what it terms the migrant “invasion” that occurred under President Joe Biden. Immigration lawyers and others warn the procedure, which comes with limited due-process protections and inhibits immigrants’ quick access to legal counsel, exacerbates the odds that asylum seekers’ fears of persecution will be overlooked—and will also inevitably scoop up some U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents, with important costs to civil liberties and constitutional rights.</p>\n\n<p>This article reviews the history of expedited removal and the Trump administration’s efforts to expand its application.</p>\n\n<div class=\"source-box-sidebar\">\n\t<p class=\"source-box-title\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Read all MPI analysis related to the Trump administration</p>\n\n\t<p><a href=\"https://www.migrationpolicy.org/programs/us-immigration-policy-program/data-and-analysis-related-trump-administration-actions\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"167\" src=\"https://www.migrationpolicy.org/sites/default/files/resize/feature_images/trump-immigration-actions2-250x167.jpg\" style=\"width: 250px; height: 167px;\" width=\"250\" /></a></p>\n\n\t<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a class=\"btn-primary\" href=\"https://www.migrationpolicy.org/programs/us-immigration-policy-program/data-and-analysis-related-trump-administration-actions\" target=\"_blank\">Read More</a></p>\n</div>\n\n<p><strong><a id=\"contested-interpretation\" name=\"contested-interpretation\"></a>A Contested Interpretation of a Longstanding Authority</strong></p>\n\n<p>Congress authorized expedited removal three decades ago, with the passage of the 1996 Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act. Since then, more than 3 million noncitizens have been removed under the authority—chiefly individuals encountered at the border or inland ports of entry (such as airports).</p>\n\n<p>President Donald Trump in his first term sought to extend the process nationwide but was slowed by a federal court, and his administration ultimately moved its attention to COVID-19-related border challenges. Just 17 noncitizens were removed through expanded expedited removal procedures during the first Trump term. Early in its second term, the administration quickly revived its more muscular interpretation of the authority, but a federal judge in August blocked geographic and other expansions. The Justice Department swiftly appealed, and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit may soon reinstate some of the changes; one member of the three-judge panel considering the nationwide expansion case has indicated she would have already removed the block.</p>\n\n<p>Yet even if the nationwide expansion remains halted, DHS can use expedited removal within a 100-mile zone of U.S. land and sea borders, an area that encompasses two-thirds of the U.S. population. Its mission may be aided by a recent Supreme Court order allowing authorities to apprehend noncitizens to check their immigration status based on their race or ethnicity, language, or type of work.</p>\n\n<div class=\"source-box-sidebar\">\n\t<p class=\"source-box-title\"><strong>Box 1.

While the statute grants leeway in using the authority, administrations mostly used it for recent border arrivals, concerned that its application in the U.S. interior would raise significant operational and civil liberties concerns.</p>\n\n<p>It quickly accounted for a significant share of removals (but not necessarily of all deportations; see Box 1). The fast-track process accounted for more than half of removals during the Biden administration, from fiscal year (FY) 2022 to FY 2024 (see Figure 1).</p>\n\n<div class=\"source-box-figure\">\n\t<p class=\"source-box-title\"><strong>Figure 1.

With the advent of expedited removal, officials could order noncitizens deported without a hearing before an immigration judge; people making asylum claims were to be quickly screened by asylum officers. The Clinton administration used the authority mostly for migrants arriving without authorization on planes, boats, and at official border posts. Its usage rose rapidly, from 23,000 deportations in FY 1997 to 89,000 in FY 1999, when it accounted for 49 percent of all 183,000 removals.</p>\n\n<p>Subsequent administrations expanded the use of expedited removal, in limited ways. In 2002, President George W. Bush’s administration extended use to migrants who arrived without authorization by sea and had been in the United States for less than two years. In 2004, the process was extended to migrants who had crossed a land border without authorization, had been in the United States for less than 14 days, and had been apprehended within 100 miles of the border.</p>\n\n<p>The Obama administration ramped up use of expedited removal, especially after an increased emphasis on border enforcement in 2011. In FY 2013, DHS conducted 198,000 expedited removals (the most ever in a fiscal year), accounting for 46 percent of all 432,000 removals (also the most in one year). In 2017, before leaving office, the Obama administration extended expedited removals to Cubans; previously, Cubans who reached U.S. soil had been granted parole to enter.</p>\n\n<p><em>Border Policies Move into the U.S. Interior</em></p>\n\n<p>The Trump administration in 2019, during its first term, expanded expedited removal across the U.S. interior. The policy was initially blocked by then U.S. District Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson (now a Supreme Court justice) who ruled the administration had not followed proper administrative procedures. In 2020, an appeals court reversed her order, finding that the administration was not required to provide advance notice of the policy. Though cleared to resume the expanded use during its final months in office, the administration by then had largely turned elsewhere; amid the COVID-19 pandemic, DHS shifted enforcement focus to border expulsions under the Title 42 public health order.</p>\n\n<p>In 2022, Biden rescinded the Trump-era expansion to the U.S. interior and instead focused on using expedited removal at the border, especially after the May 2023 end of Title 42. At that point, expedited removals accounted for the most removals since the Obama administration; 194,000 of all 330,000 removals in FY 2024 (59 percent) were under the fast-track authority.</p>\n\n<p>Upon retaking office, Trump sought to pick up where he had left off. On his second day in office, he expanded expedited removal to “the full scope of its statutory authority.” DHS has not released data on the number of expedited removals carried out from the U.S. interior since then, but the vast majority of migrants arriving at the border have been placed in expedited removal. With record low unauthorized border arrivals, Border Patrol agents have also been assigned to assist with interior arrests and removals, bringing with them their knowledge of the fast-track process.</p>\n\n<p><strong><a id=\"benefits-for-trump\" name=\"benefits-for-trump\"></a>What Expedited Removal Gives the Trump Administration </strong></p>\n\n<p>Like its predecessors, the Trump administration is relying on expedited removal to increase deportations quickly, unimpeded by lengthy adjudications or judicial review. Issuing an expedited removal order can take just a matter of hours: An immigration official quickly determines whether a noncitizen has a lawful basis for remaining in the United States; if not, the official serves a removal order. There is no administrative hearing or right to an appeal. Once approved by a supervisor, expedited removal orders are final and not reviewable.</p>\n\n<p>In many cases, noncitizens opt to avoid expedited removal by voluntarily leaving the United States without receiving a formal removal order and the consequences it brings, including a bar on re-entry for at least five years. Hundreds of thousands of noncitizens have taken voluntary return over the years.</p>\n\n<div class=\"source-box-sidebar\">\n\t<p class=\"source-box-title\"><strong>Box 2. Exceptions to Expedited Removal</strong></p>\n\n\t<p>Expedited removal cannot be used on all individuals who otherwise might be eligible:</p>\n\n\t<ul><li>Officers must attempt to verify the claim of someone who purports to be a U.S. citizen, lawful permanent resident (also known as a green-card holder), or hold refugee or asylee status. If they cannot verify the claim, the individual may seek administrative review before an immigration judge.</li>\n\t\t<li>Unaccompanied immigrant children from countries other than Mexico and Canada may not be placed into expedited removal.</li>\n\t\t<li>A noncitizen expressing a fear of return to their origin country or who intends to apply for asylum must be referred to an asylum officer for a screening interview.</li>\n\t</ul></div>\n\n<p>Proponents of expedited removal underscore the fact that typical removal proceedings in immigration court take more than two years on average, and twice as long in an asylum case, before appeals. Noncitizens wait a decade or more for an asylum interview at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), which handles claims by individuals not in removal proceedings. These delays are due to record backlogs, which swelled after historic border arrivals in recent years. (By law, asylum cases are supposed to be completed within six months, but this provision has been violated for years). Approximately 3.8 million cases were pending at immigration courts as of June 2025, of which 63 percent (2.4 million) were asylum cases. Another 1.5 million asylum applications were pending at USCIS as of March. By expanding expedited removal, the administration appears to be trying to avoid adding more cases to these backlogs.</p>\n\n<p><strong><a id=\"expanded-net\" name=\"expanded-net\"></a>How the Net Has Expanded</strong></p>\n\n<p>Coming into office, the Trump administration pledged to deport a record 1 million unauthorized immigrants per year, and expedited removal was a ready tool to meet this aim. An immediate target: unauthorized immigrants who came during the Biden administration, even if they had been explicitly allowed into the country. A hallmark of the Biden administration’s immigration approach was to use humanitarian parole and other legal processes to allow certain individuals into the United States on a temporary basis, providing protection from deportation and access to a work permit but not a pathway to a green card, in order to relieve record pressure at the border.</p>\n\n<p>During the two-year period beginning in September 2023, MPI estimates that approximately 1 million migrants were released into the United States after arriving without authorization between border posts. An additional 937,000 individuals were, from January 2023 to December 2024, permitted entry through the CBP One app, which the Biden administration used to allow asylum seekers and others to schedule appointments at official border crossings. Another 532,000 noncitizens were admitted through the Cuban, Haitian, Nicaraguan, and Venezuelan (CHNV) parole program from October 2022 through December 2024. The Trump administration terminated or ended these grants of humanitarian parole and now seeks to place former recipients in expedited removal. It has argued the law allows it to do so regardless of when the parolees entered the country. As such, these groups could theoretically be facing the prospect of fast-track deportation.</p>\n\n<p>Noncitizens who entered through parole programs or via CBP One were required to provide their contact information and U.S. addresses. This now makes it easier for authorities to track and arrest them.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, the administration has sought to end some grants of Temporary Protected Status (TPS) and deferred action, which may make more people subject to expedited removal. Litigation and ensuing court orders have resulted in a confusing legal landscape, with courts blocking the termination of TPS for more than 900,000 Venezuelans and Haitians, for example. It is unclear whether the Trump administration will allow the renewal of lapsed protections for groups such as Ukrainians who fled the 2022 Russian invasion. These and other populations are not included in MPI’s calculations of those who could be subjected to expedited removal, in part because of the likelihood of overlap with parolees as well as the ongoing litigation.</p>\n\n<p>Notably, expedited removal has historically been applied principally to Mexican and Central American nationals, and it is much easier to quickly remove someone across the U.S.-Mexico border than fly them to a faraway, overseas location. But as the origins of irregular immigrants have diversified in recent years, the administration’s attempts to quickly deport people through expedited removal could become complicated.</p>\n\n<p><em>Arrests at Immigration Courts and Asylum Offices</em></p>\n\n<p>In another shift, authorities are targeting noncitizens during their scheduled appearance in immigration court or their USCIS asylum merits interview. When a noncitizen appears for these hearings, government attorneys have in some cases moved to dismiss the case, arguing that doing so allows them to place the individual in expedited removal. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents have waited in the hallways to arrest people immediately upon the case’s dismissal.</p>\n\n<p>The actions have a two-fold benefit from the administration’s perspective, helping reach its deportation goal and reducing the asylum case backlog. In expedited removal, migrants expressing fear of return are referred to a USCIS asylum officer for a screening known as a credible fear interview, which can be scheduled as soon as 24 hours after arrest. Interviews are typically held by phone while an individual is detained. Asylum seekers who do not pass this interview can seek a judge’s review, which may be scheduled in the subsequent days. If a judge affirms the individual is not eligible for asylum, they may be immediately removed without further right to appeal.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, individuals who pass the credible fear interview are taken out of expedited removal and placed in immigration court proceedings where they may apply for asylum. As such, some migrants whose court cases were dismissed so they could be put in expedited removal may end up back in immigration court, essentially restarting the process. Still a significant percentage appears to be screened out and removed.</p>\n\n<p><em>Arrests of Long-Settled Immigrants </em></p>\n\n<p>According to MPI analysis, most of the 13.7 million unauthorized immigrants in the United States as of mid-2023 have lived here for at least a decade. While the general understanding had been that noncitizens who have resided in the United States for more than two years are exempt from being placed in expedited removal, the Trump administration has pushed the legal boundaries. ICE has argued in court that certain noncitizens may be placed in expedited removal past the two-year mark, depending on how they initially entered the country. For instance, certain noncitizens released into the country under a monitoring program and told to check in at an ICE office may years later be placed in expedited removal, ICE said in an internal directive.</p>\n\n<p>Unauthorized immigrants who have lived in the United States for long periods have also reportedly been summarily deported. In one case, a Guatemalan woman who had lived in the United States for 30 years was placed in expedited removal after a traffic stop in Phoenix. In another, a Mexican mother and her adult son, both of whom had been in the country for a decade, were deported 24 hours after their arrest during a traffic stop in Texas. Immigration attorneys have reported other cases, indicating that these may be more than isolated events.</p>\n\n<p>One reason these cases may be occurring is that the burden in expedited removal is on the individual—not DHS—to show that they have lawful immigration status, have been in the country for more than two years, or have an asylum claim. This burden and the speed of the process can lead to serious errors. In the past, U.S. citizens have been removed through expedited removal, such as in a 2000 case when Sharon McKnight, a U.S. citizen with a mental disability, was deported to Jamaica a day after returning to the United States from a long trip.</p>\n\n<p>The lack of legal representation can also exacerbate challenges for noncitizens who may not know how to exercise their rights. Most individuals facing deportation lack legal representation, and many have been issued removal orders before they can make a phone call. Lack of language interpretation can also create challenges, since approximately one in every 12 U.S. residents—including millions of U.S. citizens—had limited English proficiency as of 2023.</p>\n\n<p>Many of these issues have been persistent. In 2005, the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom found that 15 percent of requests for an asylum interview were not referred to asylum officers; follow-up reviews in 2016 and 2025 found continued issues, but did not quantify the lack of referrals. “[F]lawed screening and documentation practices, a lack of training and quality control,” and other issues “remain unaddressed 20 years later,” the commission concluded in 2025.</p>\n\n<p><strong><a id=\"court-challenges\" name=\"court-challenges\"></a>Court Challenges to Trump’s Expansion</strong></p>\n\n<p>The Trump administration’s expansion of expedited removal was quickly challenged in court by groups alleging the moves exceed statutory authority. In August, a federal judge in Washington, DC blocked the application of expedited removal to parolees, ruling the government had exceeded its authority. Days later, the same judge blocked the expansion of expedited removal into the U.S. interior, finding that the administration’s policies violated constitutional due-process rights. The Justice Department has appealed both rulings. In New York City, a federal judge in September allowed the administration to continue arresting noncitizens at immigration court hearings but made it harder for immigration judges to dismiss cases, declaring they needed to provide individualized reasons.</p>\n\n<p>While the expansion of fast-track removal authority remains paused, officials can continue to apply expedited removal to migrants encountered within 14 days of their arrival and within 100 miles of U.S. borders, as has been policy for more than two decades. This 100-mile border zone includes the largest U.S. cities—New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Houston—as well as all or the vast majority of 11 states. In total, about two-thirds of the U.S. population (213 million people) reside in this zone.</p>\n\n<p><strong>A Slippery Slope</strong></p>\n\n<p>Expedited removal is key to the administration’s goal of quickly removing a maximum number of deportable noncitizens with minimal judicial scrutiny, while also addressing a large case backlog.</p>\n\n<p>This approach contains inherent risks. ICE officers are being compelled to meet arrest targets, and this year the administration aims to hire more than 10,000 new officers, many of whom will arrive with no immigration experience. Combined with the Supreme Court’s order allowing stops based on characteristics such as race and ethnicity, language spoken, and workplace, there is a real risk of racial profiling and arresting U.S. citizens. Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh contemplated this possibility in concurring with that order, which allowed federal enforcement operations to resume in Los Angeles. A U.S. citizen or other legally present immigrant may conceivably be caught up in enforcement, Kavanaugh reasoned, but the identity check will be fast and “that individual will be free to go after the brief encounter.”</p>\n\n<p>Left unsaid is that the guarantee of a quick release necessitates all U.S. residents—including citizens and green-card holders—carry proof of their status at all times. The administration’s actions, with the Supreme Court’s assent, will almost surely lead to cases in which U.S. citizens are detained for long periods of time because they cannot quickly prove their status.</p>\n\n<p>As such, by using fact-track removals as its default deportation process, the Trump administration may be changing not just the system for removing unauthorized immigrants, but altering the way in which many U.S. residents now must interact with their government.</p>\n\n<div class=\"explainer-box-figure\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://www.migrationpolicy.org/content/sign-us-immigration-policy-beat\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"235\" src=\"https://www.migrationpolicy.org/sites/default/files/resize/pb_email_signup-3-705x235.png\" style=\"width: 705px; height: 235px;\" width=\"705\" /></a></div>\n\n<p><strong>Sources</strong></p>\n\n<p>American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). 2025. 100 Mile Border Zone.

Often, displacement crises are accompanied by strained food systems; in many cases, people from agricultural communities move to areas where resources are already scarce and where infrastructure is limited, adding pressure to food, land, and water. In these situations, women often assume new roles as providers and decisionmakers, while men lose their status as breadwinners. Furthermore, many people may be forced to flee without their spouses, often making women both the primary caregivers to children and responsible for household nutritional needs. These gendered shifts can lead to opportunities—as women drive resilience and develop innovative practices for distributing and cultivating food under constrained conditions—and also challenges, such as increased workloads and exposure to gender-based violence and other risks. Risk of gender-based violence is mainly linked to changing household dynamics, where men try to assert their authority through violence as women take on a greater role of getting food and are therefore in more vulnerable situations.  </p>\n\n<p>Events in Mozambique and Zimbabwe illustrate these dynamics. The countries are particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change and in recent years have seen hundreds of thousands of people displaced internally and, to a lesser extent, across borders. Mozambique faces a double blow, as extreme climate events have occurred alongside a violent conflict involving non-state armed groups. In these contexts, displacement-related food challenges have often reshaped or magnified traditional gender roles, at times giving women new responsibilities but not necessarily new authority.  </p>\n\n<p>This article examines the intersection of gender and food systems in displacement in Mozambique and Zimbabwe. It is based in part on participatory research that explored the experiences of climate- and conflict-displaced communities conducted by the authors in 2023 and 2024.</p>\n\n<p><strong><a id=\"gender-roles\" name=\"gender-roles\"></a>The Effects of Displacement on Gender Roles </strong></p>\n\n<p>Zimbabwe and Mozambique are highly vulnerable to the adverse effects of environmental change, which has manifested in intensified cyclones, flooding, and droughts. These climatic events have disrupted communities, leading to displacement and the destruction of critical infrastructure. Agricultural livelihoods have suffered, exacerbating poverty and vulnerability. Often the backbone of rural economies, women have found themselves on the front lines. </p>\n\n<p>Importantly, these displacement dynamics are not confined to national borders, but have increasingly taken on a regional dimension. For example, in addition to the roughly 32,000 Zimbabweans who were internally displaced in 2024, several thousand sought asylum in South Africa and a much larger number have likely moved through various legal and irregular channels in response to escalating climate extremes and deteriorating livelihoods. Similarly, more than 8,000 Mozambican asylum seekers displaced by climatic shocks and insurgencies in the northern Cabo Delgado region had crossed into Zimbabwe and other nations as of 2024, although the vast majority (approximately 580,000) were displaced internally.</p>\n\n<div class=\"source-box-sidebar\">\n\t<p class=\"source-box-title\"><strong>Box 1. Methods</strong></p>\n\n\t<p>This article is based in part on research that sought to document the lived experiences of communities affected by climate-induced displacement, to understand the intersection of climate change, migration, peace, and security. The study was conducted in three districts in Zimbabwe—Chimanimani, Chipinge, and Tsholotsho—and Nampula Province in Mozambique in 2023 and 2024.</p>\n\n\t<p>The research methodology used a mixed-methods approach that combined both qualitative and quantitative techniques. The qualitative methods were participatory and included focus group discussions, key informant interviews, and participatory rural appraisal tools such as transect walks, historical timelines, and seasonal calendars, which were used to build trust and gather detailed information. The quantitative methods were used to complement the qualitative findings and consisted of climate trend analysis, hydrological assessments, geographic information systems (GIS) mapping of environmental risks using remote sensing, and field visits with GPS mapping.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p><em>Climate-Induced Displacement in Zimbabwe</em></p>\n\n<p>Cyclone Idai in 2019 displaced about 51,000 people in Zimbabwe, especially in the eastern Chimanimani and Chipinge districts. Unprecedented rains destroyed crops at a time when many inhabitants already faced hunger due to persistent drought and a deteriorating economy. Furthermore, the cyclone did extensive damage to infrastructure and agricultural land, rendering many areas uninhabitable and diminishing the prospect of recovery. </p>\n\n<p>The cyclone came on top of longer-term challenges with food security and other issues in Zimbabwe. In 2025, nearly 7.7 million Zimbabweans face food insecurity, according to the World Food Program. Idai struck amid ongoing economic and land-governance challenges stemming from a government effort to redistribute land owned by White commercial farmers. The country also experienced severe droughts stretching back to the 1990s, plus multiple prior heavy storms. In southwestern Tsholotsho, Cyclone Dineo in 2017 displaced thousands and made food and other resources scarce.</p>\n\n<p>Displacement also increased poverty and reduced access to water, leading to conflicts between hosts and displaced communities. As one woman who had been displaced by Cyclone Dineo told the authors in Tsholotsho in December 2024, “In some cases, 60 to 70 households have to share a single borehole,” leading to increased burdens on women and social tensions over access to water.</p>\n\n<p>While in some contexts researchers have shown that displacement had an empowering effect on women, granting them new responsibilities as primary breadwinners, the experience may also intensify pre-existing gender norms or increase their vulnerability to exploitation and violence. For instance, in Chimanimani, some men held the traditional belief that women had to do all domestic chores and work in the fields. Men asserted their authority as household heads, even though they may not have labored, and sometimes stole food or forcefully sold part of the women’s harvest to buy beer and other indulgences, and became violent when confronted. Many also asserted women should not own land.</p>\n\n<p><em>Conflict and Climate in Mozambique </em></p>\n\n<p>In Mozambique, conflict significantly compounds the impacts of climate-related hazards. The country has experienced recurring violence in Cabo Delgado since 2017, where armed insurgents have launched attacks along the coastal region. These attacks have displaced more than 1 million villagers, and 580,000 were displaced as of the end of 2024. Meanwhile, Tropical Cyclone Chido displaced around 536,000 people after making landfall in and around Cabo Delgado in December 2024, in Mozambique’s second highest disaster displacement on record, after the 640,000 people displaced by Cyclone Freddy in 2023.</p>\n\n<p>Notably, the socioeconomic consequences of conflict and climate extremes have disproportionately affected women and marginalized groups. Women’s roles as caregivers, including managing household tasks and child care, compound their vulnerabilities in displacement. Their access to resources is often limited while risks of violence, exploitation, and trauma escalate.</p>\n\n<p>The authors’ fieldwork in Mozambique’s Corrane settlement for internally displaced persons (IDPs) revealed how women’s roles expanded even as their agency remained constrained, and pre-existing gender disparities were further aggravated. For example, competition between host communities and IDPs over food, land, and water created social tensions, with women often at the center due to their roles managing food and livelihoods in the household. At the same time, men faced profound disruptions of their own: Many lost their traditional roles as providers and protectors, which sometimes led to feelings of disempowerment, psychological distress, and social exclusion. In Corrane, displaced men reported struggling to find employment or meaningful economic roles, contributing to increased frustration, substance abuse, return to Cabo Delgado, or violence against women.  </p>\n\n<p>These shifts in gender roles strained household dynamics and community cohesion. Moreover, humanitarian responses often overlooked men’s psychosocial needs, focusing primarily on women and children, with adverse impacts on gender relations.   </p>\n\n<p>Mozambique’s displacement has led to a profound transformation in livelihoods, affecting individuals and communities in multifaceted ways. Displaced populations have experienced limited access to food, education, health care, land, income-generating activities, and clean water. Tensions emerged in Corrane over food, land, and water, which in certain conditions could create a breeding ground for conflict.</p>\n\n<div class=\"source-box-sidebar\">\n\t<p class=\"source-box-title\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://www.migrationpolicy.org/programs/migration-information-source/special-issue-climate-change-and-migration\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Special Issue: Climate Change and Migration</strong></a></p>\n\n\t<p>This article is part of a special series about climate change and migration.</p>\n\n\t<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://www.migrationpolicy.org/programs/migration-information-source/special-issue-climate-change-and-migration\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"210\" src=\"https://www.migrationpolicy.org/sites/default/files/source_images/climate_change_img1-250px.png\" style=\"width: 250px; height: 210px;\" width=\"250\" /></a></p>\n\n\t<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a class=\"btn-primary\" href=\"https://www.migrationpolicy.org/programs/migration-information-source/special-issue-climate-change-and-migration\" target=\"_blank\">Explore the Issue </a></p>\n</div>\n\n<p><strong><a id=\"food-systems\" name=\"food-systems\"></a>Food Systems in Displacement</strong> </p>\n\n<p>The scholar Carolyn Steel has claimed that “in order to understand cities properly, we need to look at them through food.” Though she was referring to urban areas, the insight resonates equally elsewhere; food systems are not just about economics, but shape communities’ livelihoods, social structures, and cultural identities. In times of crisis, the disruption of these systems therefore tends not only to sever feelings of home and induce food insecurity, but profoundly change communities’ cultural and social dynamics, including gender relations.</p>\n\n<p>Displacement presents unique challenges to food systems, as refugee and IDP settlements are often located in temporary or makeshift settings with little access to markets, trade routes, land, or essential resources. The absence of key components of a resilient food system—such as a stable market economy, natural resources, and productive inputs—threatens food security. Moreover, these contexts are often highly susceptible to climate hazards, due to inadequate infrastructure and poor socioeconomic conditions. The compounded, repeated, and prolonged pressures within displacement settings render food systems volatile and limit their capacity for resilience. It is within this intersection of environmental vulnerability, forced mobility, and disrupted traditional livelihoods that the critical, yet often overlooked, role of gender in food systems becomes strikingly evident.  </p>\n\n<p>Food systems in Mozambique and Zimbabwe are deeply intertwined with socioeconomic and environmental challenges. Both nations rely heavily on agriculture as a cornerstone of their food systems, with recent figures showing that approximately 70 percent of each country’s population depends on agriculture for income or employment. As such, disrupting those food systems is equivalent to upsetting the countries’ social, political and economic foundations.</p>\n\n<p>Regrettably, both countries’ food systems are highly vulnerable. Although land is abundant in many areas, its productivity is declining due to rising climatic pressures, compounded by socioeconomic strains that limit opportunities for agricultural innovation and access to irrigation, fertilizers, pesticides, and links to markets. All these aspects are even less available in displacement contexts. While these issues compromise food systems for everyone, their impacts are not felt equally; gender relations help determine who gets to eat. While women face heightened risks of food insecurity, malnutrition, and gender-based violence, men may experience loss of traditional livelihoods, identity, and social status. As such, both groups bear unequal burdens shaped by gender norms and access to resources.</p>\n\n<p><em>Gender in Displacement-Affected Food Systems</em> </p>\n\n<p>Within displacement-affected food systems, gender roles and relations are critical, particularly as displacement disrupts and reshapes traditional dynamics. Evidence indicates that displacement may magnify existing gendered inequalities and labor divisions, though in some cases it can reconfigure them. When communities are uprooted, food-related roles must adapt to new and often constrained environments. </p>\n\n<p>Women often face heightened challenges. They are typically responsible for cultivating staple crops and, post-harvest, tasks can extend to activities such as drying, storing, and processing food. Additionally, women manage essential household tasks such as meal preparation, collecting water and firewood, and ensuring family nutrition. When displacement limits access to land, agricultural inputs, and markets, women’s ability to sustain livelihoods and food security becomes restricted. </p>\n\n<p>Conversely, prior to displacement, men in both countries were primarily engaged in managing livestock, cultivating cash crops, preparing land (such as ploughing), and marketing produce, particularly for sale. Men also typically held decision-making power over land use, asset ownership, and access to external markets. Displacement disrupts these roles as well. Men lost access to and control over land and other resources, which can be perceived as a loss of status and breadwinning capability. Although all land in both countries is legally owned by the governments, land rights are commonly communal, passed down through generations. As a result, displaced populations must negotiate access with host communities that hold customary or historical claims to the land. For men, this process can be particularly disempowering or emasculating, and contributes to the scarcity of land and natural resources available to displaced populations. </p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, the breakdown of social networks and traditional support systems in displacement marginalizes women and men alike, diminishing their influence in household- and community-level decision-making and resource allocation. In both Zimbabwe and Mozambique, food systems rely heavily on rain-fed agriculture, and the lack of support in terms of agricultural inputs, assets, and secure land access further compounds food insecurity. Gendered impacts underscore the need for targeted interventions that recognize and address the differentiated experiences of men and women within displacement-affected food systems, ensuring that both are supported in rebuilding resilient and equitable livelihoods. </p>\n\n<p><strong><a id=\"challenges-missteps\" name=\"challenges-missteps\"></a>Challenges and Missteps for Humanitarian Intervention</strong></p>\n\n<p>The ability of both climate change and conflict to disrupt food systems and increase malnutrition has been well documented. As such, humanitarian actors often aim to support food systems for displaced people. In Tsholotsho, Zimbabwe, displaced people were often provided with humanitarian assistance that included housing, cash, and food supplements. However, the assistance failed to accommodate displaced peoples’ livelihoods by also including fertile land for agriculture. “There is no fertile soil and no grazing land—where will the cattle eat?” explained a displaced man in Tsholotsho. As such, various family members were forced to return to their origin areas for farming at different times of the year. Hence, displaced populations had a foot in both the destination and origin areas.</p>\n\n<p>This dynamic had several consequences. Women tended to remain in government-provided housing to take children to school, conforming with their gender–ascribed role of child rearer and caregiver. Men often had better transportation links, such as bicycles, making it easier to commute back and forth to farmland. This dynamic led many women to feel excluded, and created tensions between displaced people and the host community over access to limited shared resources such as boreholes for water.</p>\n\n<p>It also disrupted the broader food supply chain. Many women opted to feed their children and husbands first, in line with gender expectations and social norms. A common sentiment during the authors’ focus group discussions with displaced women was that, when the food was limited, they gave the children food and mothers did not eat. For instance, one woman said, “When my children ask me why I am not eating with them, I pretend that I am not hungry.”  </p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile in Mozambique, humanitarian actors at times prioritized aid for women, with multiple consequences on gender relations and household dynamics. Because many women had lost spouses and other relatives in the conflict or disasters, men arriving alone in settlements often sought out women to live with, to secure access to provisions, flipping the traditional patriarchal order of men as providers. With new relationships and family bonds formed out of necessity, women effectively became de facto breadwinners through the food rations they received from humanitarian interventions. Yet this dynamic also seemed to lead to episodes of violence against women, as men felt emasculated. </p>\n\n<p>Hence, humanitarian organizations’ attempt to promote gender equity in some ways backfired. Women reported that men remained household heads who ultimately controlled spending, exerted their authority, and expressed their financial frustrations through physical violence.</p>\n\n<p><em>Retrenchment or Re-evaluation of Gender Roles</em></p>\n\n<p>These cases underscore the multifaceted ways that displacement affects gender roles, particularly in relation to food. Traditional patriarchal structures frequently limit women's participation in decision-making about food, which can hinder the adoption of effective food-security initiatives and overlook women's practical knowledge, daily experiences, and unique needs. Displacement can further erode women's agency, making them more dependent on external aid or male relatives in new settings.</p>\n\n<p>However, displacement can also, in some cases, prompt a re-evaluation of gender roles, with both positive and negative consequences. Women may be forced into new economic roles or adopt greater responsibilities in the absence of male relatives, such as when men migrate to find work, potentially leading to increased autonomy and new forms of leadership in the long run. Similarly, men may adopt new roles within the household or community, which, as the Mozambique case demonstrates, may make them dependent on women who have assumed breadwinner status. While this can be seen as gender transformation, it might not be if men feel emasculated and lash out with violence or other abuse. From this angle, humanitarian efforts at cultural sensitivity and inclusion must strike a balance by promoting gender equity and equality while at the same time not excluding men who are also affected by food poverty. The consequences of not striking this balance may end up harming the very women whom interventions intend to protect and empower.  </p>\n\n<p><strong>The Value of a Gender Perspective </strong></p>\n\n<p>Efforts to build security and wellbeing for people on the move go hand-in-hand with efforts to build sustainable and resilient food systems. Using a gender lens on these dynamics is a helpful tool to understand them.</p>\n\n<p>In most displacement contexts, money is not circulating, and access to productive assets is extremely limited. Improving economic resilience through cash-based intervention, improved transportation, and market access could strengthen local economic value chains. This is particularly important for women who are often deprioritized for movement and market access. Additionally, it is important to keep in mind that displacement-affected food systems are often at high risk, due to poor infrastructure as well as being situated in climate-vulnerable areas. As such, access to weather forecasting, early-warning systems, and climate-smart technology and innovation is particularly important in these locations, yet severely lacking due to limited access to technology and internet services and availability in local languages.</p>\n\n<p>As policymakers and humanitarian actors seek security, they would do well to consider the impacts of both traditional and transformed gender roles in building food security and in other domains. Examples from Zimbabwe and Mozambique show the often unexpected ways that displacement can reshape gender roles, especially regarding food.</p>\n\n<p><em>The authors’ work for this article was carried out with support from the CGIAR Climate Action Science Program (CASP) and the CGIAR Food Frontiers and Security (FFS) Science Program.

Despite a recent fall in numbers, the United States remains the top destination for Chinese students studying internationally, with 277,000 attending U.S. universities and colleges in the 2023-24 school year.</p>\n\n<p>Yet the future of Chinese student migration to the United States is highly uncertain. In May 2025, the U.S. State Department announced it would “aggressively revoke” visas of certain Chinese students, especially those affiliated with the Chinese Communist Party or studying in “critical fields” which likely include advanced science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). Although the administration backed off the restrictions amid trade negotiations with Beijing, and in fact President Donald Trump has since said the government would admit 600,000 Chinese students, it has maintained an unprecedented focus on scrutinizing international students. As of August, the administration had reportedly revoked the visas for some 6,000 students of varied nationalities.</p>\n\n<div class=\"source-box-sidebar\">\n\t<p class=\"source-box-title\">In This Article</p>\n\n\t<ul><li>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"source-box-title\"><a href=\"https://www.migrationpolicy.org#trends\">Chinese student enrollment in the United States has fallen rapidly since the 2019-20 school year</a></p>\n\t\t</li>\n\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"source-box-title\"><a href=\"https://www.migrationpolicy.org#policy-history\">The United States has a long history of restricting student and other immigration from China</a></p>\n\t\t</li>\n\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"source-box-title\"><a href=\"https://www.migrationpolicy.org#survey\">Many Chinese students report discrimination and other poor experiences in the United States</a></p>\n\t\t</li>\n\t</ul></div>\n\n<p>This posture comes on top of an environment that many Chinese students say has been turning them off the United States. Even before the proposed restrictions, many Chinese students said they felt they had been treated poorly in the United States, with at least 60 percent claiming they faced discrimination, in a survey conducted as part of the authors’ research. This treatment and other factors were cited by many students who said they wanted to return to China.</p>\n\n<p>U.S. universities and employers have expressed concerns about reductions in international student enrollment. Chinese and other international students, who typically pay higher tuition than U.S.-born students, boost the finances of U.S. universities and colleges as well as the country’s economic outlook more broadly. In the 2023-24 school year, international students contributed more than $43.8 billion to the U.S. economy, according to NAFSA: The Association of International Educators. Many Chinese STEM graduates are also highly sought after in the U.S. labor market; China was the second largest origin country for immigrants receiving H-1B temporary visas for highly skilled foreign workers in fiscal year (FY) 2024, after India.</p>\n\n<p>This article provides insights on the trends in Chinese student migration to the United States and the recent experiences of these students. It is based in part on 2024 research by Multicultural Insights, conducted by the authors and other researchers, which surveyed nearly 1,300 Chinese students in the United States. The findings help explain why students were roughly equally split between those intending to remain in the United States and those planning to return to China eventually. Despite the difficulties that many students said they faced, most also expressed a desire to work in the United States after their studies, either temporarily or permanently.</p>\n\n<p><strong><a id=\"trends\" name=\"trends\"></a>Trends in Chinese Student Migration</strong></p>\n\n<p>More than 3 million individuals from China have been educated at U.S. colleges and universities since the late 1970s, following economic and social reforms in China that opened the country more fully to the world. But Chinese student enrollment has fallen rapidly since the 2019-20 school year, when a record 373,000 were studying in the United States, to 277,000 in 2023-24 (see Figure 1). For many years China was the main country of origin for international students on U.S. higher education campuses, but now it is in second place behind India, which was the origin for nearly 332,000 students in 2023-24.</p>\n\n<div class=\"source-box-figure\">\n\t<p class=\"source-box-title\"><strong>Figure 1. International Students in the United States from China, School Year 2000-01 to 2023-24</strong></p>\n\t<img alt=\"\" height=\"333\" src=\"https://www.migrationpolicy.org/sites/default/files/source_charts/fe-2025-chinesestudents-fig1-time.png\" style=\"width: 770px; height: 333px;\" width=\"770\" /><p class=\"source-box-sources\"><em>Source</em>: Institute of International Education, \"International Students by Place of Origin, Selected Years, 1949/50 - 2023/24,” 2024, <a href=\"https://opendoorsdata.org/data/international-students/all-places-of-origin/\" target=\"_blank\">available online</a>.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>Part of this decline was due to COVID-19-related restrictions on mobility in 2020 and 2021, which were more pronounced and lasted longer in China than in many other countries globally. Several other destination countries saw a similarly sharp fall in the numbers of Chinese students during this time. But while restrictions have eased, the U.S. decline has not halted. This suggests that several factors are affecting Chinese students’ decision to come to the United States—or not.</p>\n\n<p><strong><a id=\"policy-history\" name=\"policy-history\"></a>U.S. Policy towards Chinese Students</strong></p>\n\n<p>The United States has a long history of restricting immigration from China, dating back to the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, which prohibited arrivals of Chinese workers. Many prominent U.S. voices viewed Chinese immigrants as a threat to jobs and culture; the law was not repealed until 1943. Today, there is a great deal of geopolitical tension between the United States and China, which can be seen in many areas. For example, various U.S. states have passed laws restricting Chinese individuals and corporations from buying land, in response to fears that these purchases threaten U.S. security.</p>\n\n<p>Indeed, many restrictions targeting the Chinese born—including students—have been justified by security concerns. Trump in 2020 signed a proclamation barring Chinese students and researchers with ties to China’s military from obtaining visas. However, confirmed cases of Chinese students spying are rare, especially in comparison with the hundreds of thousands of Chinese students in the United States.</p>\n\n<p>Restrictive U.S. measures are by no means solely a feature of the Trump administration. Under President Joe Biden’s administration, the United States rejected 36 percent of student visa applications from China in 2023—then a record high. Independent of policy, in the aftermath of the COVID-19 outbreak, the United States also witnessed an uptick in instances of discrimination and hate crimes targeting people of Asian descent, including Chinese immigrants.</p>\n\n<p>More recently, in May 2025, the Trump administration announced the previously mentioned new restrictions on Chinese international students but then swiftly scaled them back, creating a great deal of uncertainty. China publicly condemned the U.S. actions, calling them “politically motivated and discriminatory,” and lodged a formal complaint. But some commentators have suggested that China’s policy towards these students is more nuanced, as Beijing has consistently encouraged Chinese students to return to China after their period of study abroad. At the same time, the Chinese government itself has raised questions of allegiance of U.S.-educated Chinese who return to China.</p>\n\n<p>To be sure, the United States is not the only country restricting international students. Other high-income countries including Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom have also sought to reduce student visa issuances, due to concerns about the rising scale of net migration (in the United Kingdom) or pressures on housing (in Australia and Canada). Still, with the United States the top destination for international students globally, its restrictions are especially resonant.</p>\n\n<div class=\"source-box-sidebar\">\n\t<p class=\"source-box-title\"><strong>Box 1. Methods</strong></p>\n\n\t<p>Data in this section derive from an online survey of 1,252 Chinese graduate students and two focus group interviews with eight Chinese students each in 2024, conducted by Multicultural Insights. Students were from mainland China, and not Hong Kong, Macau, or Taiwan. The survey was intended to examine the factors influencing these students’ decisions to remain in the United States or return to China after completing their studies.</p>\n\n\t<p>The study focused mainly on graduate students studying in the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields, but also included some graduate students studying social sciences. The study was one of the largest surveys of U.S.-based Chinese students conducted since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p><strong><a id=\"survey\" name=\"survey\"></a>What Chinese Students Say</strong></p>\n\n<p>Many U.S.-based Chinese students surveyed by Multicultural Insights reported very poor experiences (see Figure 2). Sixty-eight percent said they had experienced discrimination off campus, and 60 percent reported discrimination on campus in interactions with fellow students and staff. Approximately half the students claimed that they had been verbally harassed or knew of other Chinese students who had been abused; many said they had been told to “go home” or go “back to your own country.” Smaller but nonetheless notable numbers of students claimed they were unjustly accused of being spies or of cheating.</p>\n\n<div class=\"source-box-figure\">\n\t<p class=\"source-box-title\"><strong>Figure 2.

Those who reported dismissive behavior by their professors also indicated that they were more likely to want to return to China.</p>\n\n<p><em>Benefits of Living in the United States</em></p>\n\n<p>However, many Chinese students also made positive comments about the United States. Nearly three-quarters reported they chose U.S. study because they wanted to “experience life” there, and roughly two-thirds said they did so because they wanted the best education possible. Indeed, 64 percent of students reported that they believed the quality of education is better in the United States than China.</p>\n\n<p>Many students cited the personal benefits of living in the United States, including more freedom. For example, a third-year doctoral student in economics said he faced discrimination in the United States due to his Chinese origin, but also that, as a member of the LGBTQ community, he found more acceptance, openness, and respect regarding sexuality.</p>\n\n<p><em>Stay or Return?</em></p>\n\n<p>Chinese students were roughly split on their migration intentions after graduation, with a slight plurality hoping to remain (see Figure 3). Female students were more likely to want to stay in the United States: 48 percent indicated a desire to remain and 33 percent planned to leave, compared to 40 percent of men who planned to remain and 43 percent who intended to return. The reasons for these gender differences are unclear. The main reason for wanting to stay in the United States, stated by more than one-third of students who hoped to remain, was the economic prospects.  </p>\n\n<div class=\"source-box-figure\">\n\t<p class=\"source-box-title\"><strong>Figure 3.

Twenty-one percent of planned returnees cited U.S. discrimination as a motivating factor. Very few students mentioned being influenced by specific programs launched by China to attract returnees, such as the Thousand Talents Plan. Created in 2008, this government effort offers substantial financial incentives and grants to bring leading Chinese-born scientists and engineers back to China.</p>\n\n<p>It is important to note that many students reporting they would like to return to China did not intend to do so immediately, and first planned to look for temporary work in the United States. After completing their studies, nearly three-quarters of all respondents—and two-thirds of those intending to return to China—planned to apply for Optional Practical Training (OPT), which allows international students to work in the United States for up to 12 months (or 36 months for STEM graduates) in their field of study. Key Trump administration officials have called for ending OPT, and its future remains uncertain. Additionally, 56 percent of all respondents—including 24 percent of students intending to return to China—hoped to obtain an H-1B visa, which would generally permit them to remain and work in the United States for up to six years.</p>\n\n<p>Many Chinese students also see their long-term future in the United States: 42 percent said they planned to apply for U.S. legal permanent residence (LPR status, also known as getting a green card) and 29 percent wished to become U.S. citizens. For context, 55 percent of all 2.4 million Chinese immigrants in the United States were naturalized citizens as of 2023, and the 24,000 Chinese immigrants who became U.S. citizens in FY 2024 were the seventh largest national-origin group. (China does not allow dual nationality, so people from China who become citizens of another country must renounce their Chinese citizenship.)</p>\n\n<p><strong><a id=\"future\" name=\"future\"></a>Future Student Migration in Flux</strong></p>\n\n<p>In prior years, policymakers in both China and the United States broadly accepted rising student migration, with some reservations mainly linked to security concerns. Chinese student migration has provided a key source of revenue for U.S. academic institutions and a ready supply of highly skilled workers for the U.S. labor market. China has also gained from the movement, as many students return with excellent qualifications and U.S. work experience. Even if Chinese students remain in the United States long term, their presence can boost trade links and business cooperation and investment between the two countries.</p>\n\n<p>Today, it is less clear how Washington and Beijing view the future of this migration. Overall, there seems to be little dialogue between the two countries to clearly articulate and agree upon what both sides expect from the complex China-U.S. migration relationship, of which students comprise only one part. For example, results of the authors’ survey were first presented in Beijing in May 2024 at a high-level policy conference organized by a major Chinese think tank, the Center for China and Globalization; few U.S. government representatives attended the conference.</p>\n\n<p>Three key factors are likely to shape future Chinese student migration patterns. First, it is becoming more attractive for students to study in China, as the quality of Chinese academic institutes has improved and top universities score high marks in global rankings. China’s population is also declining, and the school-age population is expected to contract significantly, reducing the pool of students who might seek to study abroad.</p>\n\n<p>Second, international competition within the international education sector and for STEM workers is increasing. A likely future scenario is that an increasing number of Chinese students decide to study in countries other than the United States. This is already happening, with both Canada and the United Kingdom seeing more Chinese-born students in 2023 than in 2019, pre-pandemic.</p>\n\n<p>Third, U.S. policies aimed at restricting students from China are likely to deter more students from coming to the United States and do little to combat the negative experiences Chinese students in the United States already face.</p>\n\n<p>A further decline in Chinese student migration to the United States would likely result in a considerable loss of income for U.S. educational institutions and could have ripple effects in the U.S. economy. Other countries are investing heavily in attracting STEM students. Many companies and industries rely on advanced technologies, and attracting STEM workers is often seen as essential for maintaining a competitive advantage in the global market. According to one estimate by the Semiconductor Industry Association, there will be a STEM shortage of approximately 1.4 million technicians, computer scientists, and engineers in the United States by 2030.</p>\n\n<p>The U.S. debate about student immigration, like that in many high-income countries, has focused on numbers and efforts to reduce admissions through immigration policy. However, there is need for a much broader policy discussion, focusing on how best to balance U.S. education, labor, and immigration policies and develop innovative solutions for the future. This discussion should include a focus on reducing discrimination against the international students already resident in the United States and people of minority ancestry more broadly. This type of broader discussion about the future of student migration is already happening in many other high-income countries, where the benefits of international education have often been felt unevenly. Thus, there is much that the United States could potentially learn from other countries as it seeks to develop new approaches to managing student immigration.</p>\n\n<p>As the survey responses show, however, policy is only one factor at play. Negative experiences for Chinese-born students could dampen their interest in studying at U.S. institutions in the first place.</p>\n\n<p><em>The authors gratefully acknowledge Ling Lee of the Open Society Foundations for his assistance in helping develop and implement the survey and study. </em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Sources</strong></p>\n\n<p>Batalova, Jeanne. 2025.

"2025-11-05T00:28:34+00:00", "cleaned_text": "Reeves' pre-Budget speech fails to rule out tax rises\nChancellor Rachel Reeves has said she will make \"necessary choices\" in the Budget after the \"world has thrown more challenges our way\".\nIn an unusual pre-Budget speech in Downing Street, Reeves did not rule out a U-turn on Labour's general election manifesto pledge not to hike income tax, VAT or National Insurance.\nWhen journalists explicitly asked if the government was set to break that pledge she did not answer directly but said she was \"setting the context for the Budget\".\nConservative leader Kemi Badenoch said the speech was \"one long waffle bomb\" which had left business leaders \"none the wiser\".\nShe added that the chancellor \"does not need to put up taxes\", and should copy Conservative policies like scrapping stamp duty to \"stimulate\" the economy.\nReeves pledged to come up with a \"Budget for growth with fairness at its heart\" aimed at bringing down NHS waiting lists, the national debt and the cost of living.\nThe chancellor said she would do what was \"necessary to protect families from high inflation and interest rates, to protect our public services from a return to austerity\" and ensure the economy is \"secure with debt under control\".\nShe added that \"we will all have to contribute to that effort\".\n\"Each of us must do our bit for the security of our country and the brightness of its future.\"\nThe chancellor's speech appears to have removed any doubt over whether taxes will rise in the Budget.\nYet when pressed on which taxes might go up, Reeves refused to go into specifics.\nInstead she began the work of explaining why a year after delivering a tax-raising Budget and vowing not to come back for more, she is in fact coming back for more.\nThe chancellor said she would do what is necessary, not what is popular.\nThe reasons she gave were poor productivity, for which she blamed Conservative government policy including Brexit, austerity and short-sighted decisions to cut infrastructure spending, persistently high global inflation and the uncertainty unleashed by Donald Trump's tariffs.\nIn short, Reeves' argument is that the failings of others are being visited upon this government, and that it falls to her to confront decisions her predecessors ducked.\n\"It is important that people understand the circumstances we are facing, the principles guiding my choices – and why I believe they will be the right choices for the country,\" she said.\nFollowing the speech on Tuesday evening, Reeves appeared to rule out stepping down if she did increase income tax.\nSpeaking to LBC, it was put to her that some people would consider stepping down the right thing to do if she does break the manifesto pledge.\n\"I am not going to walk away because the situation is difficult,\" she said.\nDaisy Cooper, Treasury spokesperson for the Liberal Democrats, said: \"It's clear that this Budget will be a bitter pill to swallow as the government seems to have run out of excuses.\"\nChief Secretary to the Treasury James Murray told BBC Newsnight that the chancellor wanted to be \"upfront\" with the public about challenges in the upcoming Budget.\n\"There may be some tough decisions and people need to understand why those tough decisions are being taken,\" he said.\nWhen pressed on whether he was comfortable when politicians broke their manifesto promises to voters, Murray did not answer directly but said the chancellor was committed to tackling problems \"head on\".\nThere are some in government who want this to be a one-and-done Budget, in that they do not want to come back again and again every year, eking out a bit more money in tax to meet the requirements of the independent forecast.\nThat is seen as an argument for raising billions of pounds through increasing at least one of the income tax rates.\nHowever, it would be a big risk politically, especially with public trust in politics in general, and Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer in particular, so low.\nThere is also the question of whether the prime minister and chancellor could land the argument that none of this was foreseeable before last year's Budget.\nIt comes as the Resolution Foundation, which has close links to Labour and was previously run by Treasury minister Torsten Bell, said avoiding changes to VAT, NI or income tax \"would do more harm than good\".\nIts chief executive Ruth Curtice told the BBC \"it was very unusual for a chancellor to make a speech three weeks before the Budget\".\n\"It may simply be that there aren't enough sensible tax rises to raise the £25bn that we think she needs without touching those manifesto promises,\" she said.\nThe Resolution Foundation recommends hiking income tax as the \"best option\" for raising cash, but suggested it should be offset by a 2p cut to employee National Insurance, which would \"raise £6bn overall while protecting most workers from this tax rise\".\nRaising the basic rate of income tax has been called the 50-year tax taboo. Labour's Denis Healey was the last chancellor to do this in 1975.\nExtending the freeze in personal tax thresholds for two more years beyond April 2028 would also raise £7.5bn, the Resolution Foundation's pre-Budget analysis suggested.\nThe government's official forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), is widely expected to downgrade its productivity forecasts for the UK at the end of the month. That could add as much as £20bn to the amount the chancellor will need to find if she is to meet her self-imposed \"non-negotiable\" rules for government finances.\nThe two main rules are:\n- Not to borrow to fund day-to-day public spending by the end of this parliament\n- To get government debt falling as a share of national income by the end of this parliament\nReeves said in her speech on Tuesday that her commitment to her fiscal rules was \"iron-clad\" and gave her clearest sign yet that she wants to increase her room for manoeuvre against shocks.\n\"There is a reward for getting these decisions right to build more resilient public finances with the headroom to withstand global turbulence, giving business the confidence to invest and leaving government freer to act when the situation calls for it,\" she said.\nThe pound fell to a seven-month low against the dollar in the wake of Reeve's speech, hitting $1.31 at one point.\nThat was the lowest since early April, when US trade tariffs shook global markets.\nHowever, it had already been heading downwards, and analysts said it was partly driven by the dollar's rising value.\nKey measures of UK government borrowing costs also fell after the chancellor took to the lectern but have since risen slightly above the level they were at just before she started speaking.\nAfter the last Budget Reeves had £9.9bn of headroom, but the Resolution Foundation said subsequent policy U-turns and changes in the economic outlook have turned that into a £4bn black hole.\nThe group urged Reeves to double the level of headroom to £20bn in order to \"send a clear message to markets that she is serious about fixing the public finances, which in turn should reduce medium-term borrowing costs and make future fiscal events less fraught\".\nLast month, the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said there was a \"strong case\" to increase fiscal headroom.\nThe think tank said the lack of a bigger buffer created instability, and could leave the chancellor \"limping from one forecast to the next\".", "summary": "(summarizer_error: 401 Client Error: Unauthorized for url: https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions)"}

But not this time.\nWhy?\nYou can pick your expression of choice: softening up, expectation management, pitch-rolling. They all translate as preparing us for unpopular choices to come.\nReeves volunteering to commandeer the broadcasting apparatus of Downing Street – the specially built news conference room in No 9 – tells you everything about the scale of what she is toying with at the end of the month.\nWell, I say everything, not quite. The actual choices, the decisions, including which taxes will go up and by how much, will come at the end of the month.\nWhat we got this morning was the argument, the case for what she will do. One senior figure said to me, think of the news conference as being like the first five pages of the chancellor's speech on Budget Day, in which she sketches out the economic landscape as she sees it before she announces what she is going to do.\nOn the day itself, reporters tend to gloss over those opening pages afterwards, because the choices are more newsworthy than the argument.\nSo, the Treasury's rationale goes, Reeves wanted to set out the argument in isolation today, so it does get heard.\nIn the next three weeks, expect plenty of focus on page 21 of Labour's election manifesto from last year.\nHere is what it says, in black and white: \"Labour will not increase taxes on working people, which is why we will not increase National Insurance, the basic, higher or additional rates of income tax, or VAT.\"\nIt is why I chose to read it out, word for word, to the chancellor in the news conference – scrutinising their promises on your behalf.\nReeves told me she regarded it as a \"courtesy\" to you to set out in broad terms the trade-offs she is contemplating.\nSenior government figures know that driving a coach and horses through that manifesto promise will be visible from space and could be a, if not the, defining moment for Sir Keir Starmer and Reeves.\nOf course, perhaps in the end she will choose not to put up income tax – and be able to say words to the effect of \"it wasn't as bad as you thought\".\nBut economists are suggesting that perhaps, given the state of the books, the government might have run out of better ideas.\nAnd barely anyone now disputes taxes are going up, whichever ones they might be.\nSign up for our Politics Essential newsletter to keep up with the inner workings of Westminster and beyond.", "summary": "(summarizer_error: 401 Client Error: Unauthorized for url: https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions)"}

It is also public recognition that it has to talk to the UK about its future - and about potential change.\nThe council, which is unrelated to the European Union, is the international political body in Strasbourg that oversees and enforces the work of the European Court of Human Rights.\nThe court rules on how to interpret human rights law in its 46 member states. In the UK, the government and judges must take these rulings into account, but are not bound by judgments that do not closely relate to our circumstances.\nSir Keir Starmer's government has committed to changing how the government interprets the right to privacy and family life so that it can't be used by illegal immigrants to frustrate their removal from the country.\nIn a speech earlier this year in Strasbourg, Shabana Mahmood, then justice secretary and now home secretary, said the convention itself must evolve to maintain public confidence.\nThe Conservatives and Reform are calling for the UK to walk away from the treaty, claiming Strasbourg's human rights law is a block on managing borders.\nNine EU nations, led by Denmark and Italy, have also called for major changes - which would need the agreement of all member states.\nIn a rare interview about the ECHR's relationship with the UK at the council's headquarters in France, Berset told the BBC: \"I am ready, absolutely ready, and really open to engage in all political discussions, to see what we need to discuss, maybe to change or to adapt.\n\"Let us engage on migration issues and to see what we need to address and maybe to change.\n\"The most important point is to be ready to speak on all issues without taboo... and to see then what could be the possible consensus between member states.\"\nCritics of the ECHR say that the advantage of leaving for the UK would be to take back control over human rights law.\nBut Berset said: \"The opposite is true. What I see is more the risk to be a bit isolated. It would mean to be not participating to all the discussion on migration, to take an influence.\"\nWhile he said he would not comment on internal politics in the UK, Berset appealed for the debate over the ECHR had to return to \"facts\".\nLast month, British ministers won the backing of 16 other countries at a meeting in Denmark to find ways to revise how their individual courts interpret parts of the ECHR. The aim would be to make it easier for governments to remove someone with no right to be in a country, even if they claim they have a settled family life. One British official involved in the talks described it as a \"pivotal\" meeting in the history of the ECHR\nIt's not clear how long that work will take - and whether it will ultimately lead to a complete reworking of parts of the ECHR. That could take years to diplomatically agree while claims and counter-claims about ECHR continued.\nMr Berset denied that the convention was a friend of terrorists or illegal immigrants, following claims that the court had prevented the deportation of illegal immigrants and migrants who commit criminal offences.\nHe said the UK also had to consider how leaving would effect Northern Ireland's power sharing agreement and the post-Brexit deal with the EU, both of which include a legal commitment to shared human rights principles.\nLeaving, he argued, would send a \"really negative signal\" for Ukraine because of the Council of Europe's central role, supported by the UK, in preparations for tribunals in relation to war crimes.\nThe world where we are now is bit more dangerous than was the case 20 - 25 years ago,\" said Berset. \"And it's exactly for those moments that the Council of Europe was created.\n\"Churchill was the father of the Council of Europe, and the convention. It will be quite difficult and really hard to see this [the UK quitting]. There is no alternative. We need to have some room, places, where we are in discussion together.\"\nHe added: \"Are we able to avoid the wars to make sure that in this phase of divergence that we are witnessing right now, are we strong enough to make sure again, that we have convergence, take control of what we want to have as a future collectively?\"", "summary": "(summarizer_error: 401 Client Error: Unauthorized for url: https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions)"}

In May of this year, he said that he'd received a third offer for less than 50% of his original claim.\nSir Alan was part of the Group Litigation Order compensation scheme, under which claimants can either receive £75,000 or seek their own settlement.\nFormer sub-postmaster Tim Brentnall from Pembrokeshire had his conviction overturned after he was prosecuted for false accounting.\nBrentnall told BBC Radio Wales Drive that Sir Alan's \"tenacity and dogged spirit\" kept him and other sub-postmasters going over the past 20 years.\n\"We all owe him a great debt.\"\nThe Post Office/Horizon scandal reached new heights in the public consciousness last year after Sir Alan's campaign for justice was portrayed in the ITV drama series Mr Bates vs the Post Office.\nThe government adopted all but one of the recommendations of a report published following a public inquiry into the scandal.\nThe inquiry detailed the full human impact of the scandal for the first time: the report said that more than 13 people may have taken their own lives as a result of what happened to them.\nEarlier this year, Sir Alan accused the government of putting forward a \"take it or leave it\" offer of compensation amounting to less than half of his claim.\nMany victims have previously complained about being forced to accept low offers of compensation, without the benefit of legal help.\nLast month, the government announced that all victims who are claiming compensation will now be entitled to free legal advice to help them with their offers.\nThere are three different compensation schemes, which are aimed at different groups of victims.\nIndividual eligibility for compensation depends on the particular circumstances of each case.\nHowever, the schemes have been criticised for being too slow and complicated, with many of the worst-affected victims receiving far less than their original claims.\nSir Alan told the inquiry that, as part of his plan to claim his own settlement, his lawyers had included compensation for his 20 years of campaigning for justice for other victims.\nHe said: \"I'm trying to fight for everyone's financial redress in this but I've also got to fight for my own as well.\"\nHe said his lawyers added the 20 years' compensation to his claim without his knowledge.", "summary": "(summarizer_error: 401 Client Error: Unauthorized for url: https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions)"}

And we fight. We fight like hell.\"\nThe two sections of the speech that were edited together were more than 50 minutes apart.\nThe \"fight like hell\" comment was taken from a section where President Trump discussed how \"corrupt\" US elections were. In total, he used the words \"fight\" or \"fighting\" 20 times in the speech.\nAfter showing the president speaking, the programme played footage of flag-waving men marching on the Capitol, the Telegraph said.\nAccording to the leaked memo, this \"created the impression President Trump's supporters had taken up his 'call to arms'\". But that footage was in fact shot before the president had started speaking.\nOn 6 January 2021, hundreds of Trump supporters stormed the US Capitol, protesting about Joe Biden's election victory. Five people died in relation to the riot.\nThe House of Representatives accused Trump of encouraging violence with false claims of election fraud, but he was acquitted of an impeachment charge that he incited a mob to storm the Capitol.\nAccording to the Telegraph, the document said Panorama's \"distortion of the day's events\" would leave viewers asking: \"Why should the BBC be trusted, and where will this all end?\"\nWhen the issue was raised with managers, the memo continued, they \"refused to accept there had been a breach of standards\".\nSpeaking to GB News on Tuesday, Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said the edits were \"absolutely shocking\", adding: \"That is fake news, actually putting different things together to make something look different from what it actually was.\n\"And I do think heads should roll. Whoever it was who did that should be sacked, that's what Tim Davie should be doing, identifying who put out misinformation, and sacking them.\"\nShe continued: \"The public need to be able to trust our public broadcaster... They should not be telling us things that are not true.\n\"This is a corporation that needs to hold itself to the highest standards, and that means that when we see people doing the wrong thing, they should be punished, they should be sacked.\"\nFormer prime minister Boris Johnson also said the corporation needed to respond, asking on X: \"Is anyone at the BBC going to take responsibility - and resign?\"\nThe Telegraph said the report it had obtained about BBC bias was written by Michael Prescott, formerly an independent external adviser to the broadcaster's editorial guidelines and standards committee. He left the role in June.\nThe newspaper said a whistleblower sent a copy of the 19-page dossier to every member of the BBC board last month. BBC News has not seen a copy of the memo.\nIn its statement, the BBC said: \"Michael Prescott is a former adviser to a board committee where differing views and opinions of our coverage are routinely discussed and debated.\"\nBBC News has approached Mr Prescott for comment.\nBBC Arabic under scrutiny\nMeanwhile, the Telegraph has also reported that Mr Prescott raised concerns about a lack of action to address \"systemic problems\" of bias in BBC Arabic's coverage of the Israel-Gaza war.\nThe paper said BBC Arabic put some pro-Hamas and antisemitic commentators on air hundreds of times, and that Mr Prescott said an internal report found \"stark differences\" between how BBC Arabic and the main BBC News website covered the conflict.\nMr Prescott said BBC Arabic's treatment of one story \"was designed to minimise Israeli suffering and paint Israel as the aggressor\", while allegations against Israel were \"raced to air\" without adequate checks, suggesting either carelessness or \"a desire always to believe the worst about Israel\", the Telegraph reported.\nIn response, a BBC spokesperson said: \"With regard to BBC News Arabic, where mistakes have been made or errors have occurred we have acknowledged them at the time and taken action.\n\"We have also previously acknowledged that certain contributors should not have been used and have improved our processes to avoid a repeat of this.\"", "summary": "(summarizer_error: 401 Client Error: Unauthorized for url: https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions)"}

Immediately relations improved and the threat to staff wellbeing appears to be removed\".\nChina is not believed to have an organisation named National Security Service, so it is not clear who the individuals were.\nA few months later, at the start of this year, Prof Murphy was told by the university that she could not continue her work on China. She started legal action for infringement of her academic freedom.

Or keep having sick days and holidays?\" she says.\nAccording to research from the social enterprise Fertility Matters at Work, Natalie is one of the around 63% of employees undergoing IVF who are taking sick leave to undergo treatment - with most citing they were doing so to hide their treatment from their employer.\nNow there are calls for women undergoing fertility treatments to have the legal right to paid time off to attend their appointments.\nCampaigners claim that while some employers offer fertility support, it is unequal and not guaranteed, and should be classed as a medical procedure.\nBecoming pregnant through IVF enables the same maternity rights as non-IVF pregnancies, but currently in employment law there are no legal rights when it comes to fertility treatment.\nAccording to Fertility Matters at Work's research, that comes at a potential cost of millions to the economy and businesses in lost productivity.\nNatalie says she has avoided bringing her treatment up with her managers because she is nervous about the reception she might get for taking time off work to go through the process.\n\"If I was to go to my managers and say I was pregnant, I wouldn't feel nervous at all about that...but with this, because you don't know how long it's going to go on for, you can't give work a timescale.\"\nEmployment guidance from the Equality and Human Rights Commission advises \"good practice\" to employers with workers seeking leave for IVF treatment, but it acknowledges that such requests are not covered by the protected characteristic of pregnancy and maternity in law.\nHowever, refusing to grant someone leave for fertility treatment could count as sex discrimination in certain situations - but campaigners say this is hard to prove.\n'Employers could benefit too'\nBecky Kearns, from Fertility Matters at Work, co-founded the group with two other women after they all experienced their own difficulties undergoing IVF whilst trying to keep afloat in the workplace.\nThe 39-year-old says providing time off would be a potential benefit of employers, who could save the economy millions in lost productivity.\n\"What we're finding is, because there's 63% taking sick leave, that is having an impact on businesses, there's a cost for the disruption of this absence.\"\nShe also thinks employers need to be more aware of the toll IVF - which she considers a \"significant life event\" - can take on their employees.\n\"You often have a number of very short notice appointments you have to attend, it's very dependent on how your body is responding to medication.\n\"But we also know there's still a huge amount of stigma that surrounds IVF and infertility.\n\"We receive messages almost daily from people who are struggling with this experience...people taking sick leave to hide treatment, the fact that they're then triggered on absence procedures and potentially having their performance monitored.\n\"And it was all because they were going through fertility treatment and just felt unable to say that was what they were going through.\"\nShe says women have also told them they have left jobs and signed non-disclosure agreements as a result of going through IVF.\nThe government says that while no specific legal right to time off for IVF treatment exists, it expects employers to treat staff fairly and accommodate reasonable requests.\nThe government also says it is strengthening flexible working rules which will make it easier for employees to agree arrangements with their workplace for support.\nBut that isn't enough reassurance for the Labour MP Alice MacDonald, who will be introducing the issue in Parliament via a ten minute rule bill, which proposes to put into law the legal right to time off for fertility appointments.\nWhilst it is unlikely the issue becomes law without official government backing, she is seeking to get it \"firmly on the government's radar\".\n\"Many people, especially women, are impacted by this when you're trying to have a baby and through no fault of your own, you need that extra medical support, you don't have a right to time off to go to those appointments,\" she says.\n\"At a time when you are hoping that it's going to work, hoping it's going to be successful, finally be pregnant and have the baby you've wanted you've got another additional barrier which is with your employer.\n\"There are many employers who are supportive but you have to hope you've got one that understands and who will give you the time off.\n\"If it was clearly in law what your rights are we think it opens up that conversation and employers would have to have a policy.\"\n'Striking a balance'\nPatrick Milnes from the British Chambers of Commerce says there is a concern amongst businesses about the potential for \"over legislation\" in anticipation of the Employment Rights Bill in particular, which will seek to ease rules on flexible working.\n\"Small and medium businesses in particular have been talking to us about how concerned they are about navigating different types of legislative leave,\" he says.\n\"Most employers that we speak to are doing this kind of thing anyway as a matter of good practice.\n\"If you legislate, those processes can become more complicated it can become more burdensome, and actually in many instances it's easier to do these things on a case by case, ad hoc basis.\n\"There's a middle ground between having nothing at all and having a full legislated process that might be overwhelming in some instances.\"\nBut Natalie says legal rights to time off would make a \"huge\" difference to her.\n\"If you didn't have to think about, 'what are work going to think about me being off again?' it would take a lot of the stress away.\n\"I'm at the beginning stages [of IVF] and I'm thinking about what it's going to look like work-wise going forward.\n\"I don't want this to be a thing forever, for other women that are also going to go through it. I think it's an important thing that needs to be fixed.\"", "summary": "(summarizer_error: 401 Client Error: Unauthorized for url: https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions)"}

Well done Laura!\"\nOver the following months her unit published four reports, including into car parts and cotton for clothing, trying to trace supply chains and highlight where goods reaching western consumers may have been produced with inputs made with forced labour in Xinjiang.\nChina denies such practices occur.\nThe Chinese Embassy in London told the BBC \"the Helena Kennedy Centre at the Sheffield Hallam University has released multiple fake reports on Xinjiang that are seriously flawed\".\n\"It has been revealed that some authors of these reports received funding from certain US agencies,\" the Embassy added.\nProf Murphy told the BBC she has received funding over the course of her career from the US National Endowment for Humanities for work on slave narratives, the US Department of Justice for work on human trafficking in New Orleans, and more recently from USAID, the US State Department and the UK Foreign Office for her work on China.\nThe Chinese Embassy said the allegations of \"forced labor\" in her reports \"cannot withstand basic fact-check\".\n\"While presenting itself as an academic body, the Centre has in practice acted as a vehicle for politicised and disinformation-driven narratives deployed by anti-China forces,\" the embassy added.\nThe university realised it was coming in for criticism from China as far back as 2022.\nAn internal university email from August of that year, seen by the BBC, said China's foreign ministry had issued a statement \"denouncing us as being in the 'disreputable vanguard of anti-China rhetoric'\".\nThe email said the university had admitted 500 Chinese students in 2018, but numbers had collapsed in the pandemic and had not bounced back like it had in other markets.\nIt expressed concern that the Chinese government's criticisms could result in a \"boycott\" by prospective students and recruitment agents.\nIn total, the documents show Sheffield had earned £3.8m in 2021/22 from China and Hong Kong.\nLater in August 2022 the university's English language testing website used by Chinese students to take tests before coming to Sheffield had been \"shut down in China temporarily\".\nOver the next two years the pressure escalated dramatically leading university officials to write in an email in May 2024 that \"the continuation of the university's scholarly activity with and in China and Hong Kong has been placed at risk because of the research activities, led by Professor Laura Murphy, in relation to alleged persecution of Uyghur Muslims in Xinjiang, China\".\nAn internal \"risk summary,\" dated 9 December 2024, detailed what had happened.\nIn August 2022, China had blocked access to the university's websites. All email communication from and to the university was disabled.\nIt meant students in China due to study at Sheffield Hallam were unable to access the enrolment website, arrange their welcome or airport pick up in the UK, or course information.\nThe university said this had \"undoubtedly had a negative impact on recruitment\" in 23/24, with \"anticipated further decline in 24/25\".\nAnd, in 2024, the intimidation began.\n\"Things in Beijing have kicked off,\" an internal email from 18 April 2024 said.\nThe risk summary detailed that \"three officers of the National Security Service\" visited Sheffield Hallam's office in China.\nA local staff member was \"questioned for two hours regarding the HKC research and future publications.\n\"The tone was threatening and message to cease the research activity was made clear.\"\nAt another visit, security officers said the internet issues were because the Uyghur research was available on the university website.\nFinally, in September 2024, the document states \"a decision by the university not to publish a final phase of the research on forced labour in China was communicated to the National Security Service .. immediately relations improved and the threat to staff wellbeing appears to be removed\".\nSheffield Hallam says these internal communications need to be seen in context and do not represent university policy.\nComplicating things for Sheffield Hallam had been a report by its Forced Labour Lab published December 2023 into clothing supply chains connected to Xinjiang.\nSmart Shirts Ltd, a Hong Kong supplier of garments with customers in the UK, brought a claim for libel, alleging it had been defamed as its name was included.\nA preliminary ruling at the High Court in London in December 2024 found that report had been \"defamatory\".\nA full trial in that case is yet to take place at which Sheffield Hallam will be able to put forward its defence to the company's claim, but the university was told by its insurers that \"any defamation, libel or slander\" claims linked to its entire Social and Economic Research Institute were no longer covered.\nProfessor Murphy had, meanwhile, built an international profile.\nHer work had been cited in the UK parliament, in Canada and in Australia. She had taken a career break in late 2023 to work for the US Department of Homeland Security, helping it with the implementation of their Uyghur Forced Labour Prevention Act.\nIn her absence, and amid the pressure from China and the lawsuit, Sheffield Hallam decided her unit would close in early 2025.\n\"Despite significant offers of continued funding we have decided it is in our best interests to terminate the research,\" an email of August 2024 said.\nIt added that by not publishing the final report under the university's auspices it hoped \"we can minimise the possibility of any further scrutiny of our operations .. thereby attending to related duty of care issues\".\nBut failing to publish the report was a breach of the terms agreed with the external groups who had agreed to fund the research.\nSo the university decided to close the unit and not use any outstanding funds.\nSheffield Hallam said it was normal practice for research groups to stand down at the end of an external contract.\nWhen Prof Murphy returned from her career break in early 2025, the university told her of its \"decision not to continue with her research into supply chains and forced labour in China due to .. the corporate insurance position .. and our duty of care to colleagues working in both China and the UK\".\nAny other work or public engagements outside the university would also have to be checked for \"conflict of interest\".\nSeeking to continue her work, Prof Murphy began her legal action and made a subject access request to the university requiring it to turn over relevant internal documents.\n\"What about the duty of care to me and the duty of care to the rest of my research team?,\" Prof Murphy told the BBC.\n\"They laid off my entire research team. Sent them away. They sent back all of our research funding, and they shuttered the entire programme without regard for the people who worked with us on that project, so many of them Uyghur folks.\"\nShe added: \"As long as the university system in the UK is so wildly underfunded as it is now, universities will be vulnerable to attacks like this.\"\nAfter receiving her apology from the university and a pledge to protect her academic freedom, she is not currently pursuing her legal action.\nHer case had been built on the Higher Education (Freedom of Speech) Act 2023, which places on universities a duty to promote freedom of speech and academic freedom for their staff.\nHer solicitors, Leigh Day, had argued that a lack of insurance and \"unspecified\" concerns about staff safety do not provide universities carte blanche to restrict freedoms.\nThe law firm believes refusing to authorise any research on a particular country would be unlawful.\nSheffield Hallam's spokesperson said: \"For the avoidance of doubt, the decision was not based on commercial interests in China.\n\"Regardless, China is not a significant international student market for the university.\"\nThe university only enrolled 73 students from China in 2024/25.\nThe Chinese Embassy said \"there are over 200,000 Chinese students in the UK, making China the largest source of international students in the UK,\" adding \"educational cooperation has become a driving force in bilateral ties\".\nBaroness Helena Kennedy KC, patron of the centre that bears her name, said UK universities were \"vulnerable\" to pressure from China because \"bringing in Chinese students is one of the ways of dealing with the financial crises that universities are facing\".\n\"If we see limitations being made on the kind of research that goes on in these universities, I think we should be alarmed,\" added the Labour peer, who has herself been sanctioned by China for speaking out about issues related to Xinjiang.\nSign up for our Politics Essential newsletter to keep up with the inner workings of Westminster and beyond.", "summary": "(summarizer_error: 401 Client Error: Unauthorized for url: https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions)"}

A total of £4bn in funding to tackle the housing problem had already been announced.\nThe government says it has also identified surplus MoD land which could be used to build 100,000 new homes for civilian and military families.\nHealey said: \"This is a new chapter - a decisive break from decades of underinvestment, with a building programme to back Britain's military families and drive economic growth across the country.\"\nAlmost three years ago, the BBC was contacted by families in military accommodation in Sandhurst who had been living without heating for days.\n\"We're at breaking point and something has to change. The system is broken,\" they said at the time.\nIn response to the story, the MoD said it was working with its contractors to improve the service. But a report released in December last year found those problems \"still exist\".\n\"It is shocking that until a policy change in 2022, it was considered acceptable to house families in properties known to have damp and mould,\" the report said.\nThe MoD last year announced it would acquire 36,347 military houses from property company Annington Homes for nearly £6bn, reversing a privatisation deal struck in 1996 under the Conservative government.\nThe deal would save millions in rent and maintenance costs, the MoD said, money that would be put towards fixing military accommodation.", "summary": "(summarizer_error: 401 Client Error: Unauthorized for url: https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions)"}

Gov.uk One Login and Gov.uk Wallet.\nOne Login is a single account for accessing public services online, which the government says more than 12 million people have already signed up to.\nBy this time next year that might be as many as 20 million, as people registering as company directors will have to verify their identity through One Login from 18 November.\nGov.UK Wallet has not yet been launched but it could eventually allow citizens to store their digital ID - including name, date of birth, nationality and residence status, and a photo - on their smartphones.\nUsers will need a Gov.UK One Login to access the wallet.\nLast month, the government launched a digital identity card for military veterans to test the concept.\nThe government hopes to avoid security issues by keeping the personal details to be accessed through One Login in individual government departments rather than in a single, centralised database.\nBut veteran civil liberties campaigner and Conservative MP David Davis has raised concerns about potential flaws in the design and implementation of One Login that he says could leave it -

foreign nations, ransomware criminals, malevolent hackers and even their own personal or political enemies.\n\"As a result, this will be worse than the Horizon [Post Office] scandal.\"\nDavis has written to spending watchdog the National Audit Office calling for an \"urgent\" investigation into the cost of One Login, which he says is certain to rise above the £305m already earmarked for it.\nIn his letter, the MP highlights a 2022 incident, in which it was found that the One Login system was being developed on unsecured workstations by contractors without the required security clearance in Romania.\nDavis also points out that One Login does not meet the government's own requirements to be classified as a safe and trusted identity supplier.\nThe government has blamed a supplier for allowing its Digital Identity and Attributes Trust Framework certification to lapse earlier this year and says it is working towards it being restored, which will happen \"imminently\".\nSeparately, Liberal Democrat technology spokesman Lord Clement-Jones has questioned whether One Login meets National Cyber Security Centre standards.\nThe peer says he has been speaking to a whistleblower, who claims that the government has missed the 2025 deadline set out in its national cyber security strategy for hardening \"critical\" systems against cyber attacks.\nMinisters deny this but the Lib Dem peer said he had been told by an official that One Login would not pass the required security tests until March 2026.\nThe whistleblower also highlighted an incident from March this year, when a so-called \"red team\" tasked with simulating a real life cyber attack was reportedly able to gain privileged access to One Login systems.\nThe Department for Science, Innovation and Technology (DSIT) says it is unable to give details of the red team exercise for security reasons but says claims that its systems were penetrated without detection are false.\nDSIT officials also assured Lord Clement-Jones that the subcontractors in Romania were \"a handful of people\" none of whom had access to production \"and all code was checked\".\nThe department says all members of the team working on One Login use \"corporately managed\" devices which are monitored by a security team to detect any malicious activity.\nBut Lord Clement-Jones told the BBC he was not convinced by the department's assurances.\nHe said the track record of successive governments of running One Login and other systems \"should give us all no confidence at all that the new compulsory digital ID, which will be based on them, will ensure that our personal data is safe and will meet the highest cybersecurity standards\".\nLast week, the prime minister handed overall control of the digital ID scheme to the Cabinet Office, which is headed by one of his most trusted and senior ministers Darren Jones, reflecting its importance to the government.\nBut the Government Digital Service, which is part of DSIT, will retain responsibility for design of the project.\nA DSIT spokesperson said: \"Gov.UK One Login continues to deliver for citizens across the UK.\n\"One Login is now home to more than 100 services and has been used by more than 12 million people - representing almost a sixth of the UK population.\n\"One Login follows the highest security standards used across government and the private sector and is fully compliant with UK data protection and privacy laws.\n\"The system undergoes regular security reviews and testing, including by independent third-parties, to ensure security remains strong and up to date.\"", "summary": "(summarizer_error: 401 Client Error: Unauthorized for url: https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions)"}

We didn't want to raise taxes,\" she told the BBC.\nA Labour spokesperson said: \"We'll take no lectures from the Conservatives - they crashed the economy, sent mortgages rocketing and left NHS waiting lists at record highs.

The Tories simply aren't serious and they've learned no lessons.\"\nThe Tories have also attacked Reeves after she apologised for failing to get a licence that was required to rent out her home after an \"inadvertent error\".\nThe chancellor has said she applied for the licence \"as soon as it was brought to my attention\".\nBadenoch said that if Reeves is found to have broken the law, she should resign.\nThe government is facing a bigger-than-expected hole in the public finances as it prepares for next month's Budget.\nIt is understood the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) is set to revise down its predictions for productivity of the UK economy, leading to a £20bn gap in meeting the chancellor's tax and spending rules.\nThere has been growing speculation the government could break its manifesto pledge and increase income tax.\nSome senior Labour figures are privately suggesting to Reeves that now is the time to make the case for such a move.\nThey argue it is still years until the next general election, it could raise a lot of money and, unlike more targeted tax rises such as last year's changes to inheritance tax on farmland, would not create a single noisy lobby group in opposition.\nBut the idea leaves other Labour figures deeply nervous because it would amount to a spectacular breach of their pre-election promise, which ministers have repeated many times since.\nSome also worry it could depress the economy further at a time of weak economic growth.\nSign up for our Politics Essential newsletter to keep up with the inner workings of Westminster and beyond.", "summary": "(summarizer_error: 401 Client Error: Unauthorized for url: https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions)"}

Lower productivity means weaker growth in the economy, hitting tax income and affecting assumptions about how much money the chancellor has to find to meet her financial rules.\nReeves also pointed to other external forces - tariffs and supply chain disruption – for the underwhelming performance of growth and inflation.\nBut some of these were foreseeable. Even if the official assessment is worse than thought, productivity - a measure of the output of the economy per hour worked - has long been problematic.\nAnd when it comes to external factors, President Trump's trade hostilities, for example, are expected to have a very limited impact on growth.\nEconomists say the chancellor may need tax rises totalling some £30bn to meet her financial rules by a comfortable margin.\nReeves accused past Conservative governments of prioritising political convenience, but her fiscal position also reflects similar actions by her own government.\nThe public purse is having to find several billions of pounds to fund U-turns over welfare and Winter Fuel Payments.\nAnalysts, including those at the Bank of England, also point to the chancellor's own tax rises in last year's Budget as hindering growth and employment, and adding to inflation pressures this year.\nIt was always risky for Reeves to suggest she wouldn't be back for another hefty tax raid. She met her financial rules by only a slim margin last year. The gamble didn't pay off, but it can't just be blamed on ill winds from elsewhere.\nIt now appears that taxes are going to rise – and significantly. The chancellor argues money is needed to support the extra funding that has been put into public services, but the performance of these services depends on more than just cash.\nOfficial figures indicate that in the year after Labour came to power, the public sector, and in particular healthcare, became less efficient as productivity dropped. There's more work to be done if we're to get bang for our buck.\nFor the actual detail on which taxes will rise, we'll have to wait until the Budget.\nBut by skirting around the issue of whether manifesto pledges will be adhered to, while claiming to have inherited a dire environment, the chancellor has stoked speculation that income tax rates may rise.\nThe pledges of not increasing the main rates of VAT, employee National Insurance Contributions and income tax always seemed risky to economists – the \"big three\" account for the majority of tax take. But they are also the most visible taxes for the public, and their inclusion in the manifesto made them appear taboo, glass only to be broken in cases of emergency.\nA rise in, say, income tax rates may come to pass (perhaps accompanied with a cut in National Insurance to offset the impact on workers). But it may not.\nThe Budget is still being put together. The door to breaking manifesto pledges may have been deliberately nudged open so that if it doesn't come to pass, then an alternate package of tax rises, however large, would be greeted with relief.\nThere are a multitude of other options to consider– a levy on banks or the gambling industry, a further freezing of the thresholds at which different rates of taxes on incomes become applicable (so-called fiscal drag), a change in the liability of partnerships for National Insurance and even the tax treatment of pension levies have all been mooted.\nAnd those tax rises will still be substantial, and felt primarily in the pockets of the better off.\nFinding tax rises of the tune of £20-£30bn - sucking that amount out of the economy - is impossible without affecting incomes or profits, which risks damaging the outlook for growth.\nHowever big the tax bill, this Budget may not deliver everything the chancellor wishes for.", "summary": "(summarizer_error: 401 Client Error: Unauthorized for url: https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions)"}

Polite nods in both directions were the order of the day. It has been deliberate - \"don't upset the Queen, don't upset the King.\"\nIn our political system, it's hard to think of other areas where there is the same kind of unwritten rule. The former No 10 source says the prime minister is rarely told to not do something, but when it comes to the royals, aides and officials are \"preprogrammed\" to advise: do not get involved.\nThere have, of course, always been notable exceptions.\nFormer Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is a republican, and questioned whether the royal family should be scaled back.\nBoris Johnson infuriated the Palace when he closed down Parliament for weeks, suspected of seeking to stop MPs trying to thwart his ambition to take the UK out of the EU. For the Palace, that nakedly political action was deeply uncomfortable.\nDavid Cameron was rapped on the knuckles when he claimed the late queen \"purred\" down the phone line when he told her the result of the Scottish referendum.\nThe leader of the Greens, Zack Polanski, tells me they are a republican party, and there are plenty of proud republicans peppered through Labour, the SNP, and Lib Dem ranks, although those aren't the parties' official positions.\nThe truth is, for those in, or close to power, the monarchy is not just a fact of political life, but part of it. The reason? Don't forget, the crown is depicted on the headed paper of government documents, on the front of our laws, and stamped on the side of ministers' red boxes. The government is his or her majesty's administration.\nMinisters are appointed by the Crown. And that's not just abstract. Senior politicians who attend the Privy Council will see the monarch on a regular basis. The prime minister famously has an \"audience\", a one-to-one chat, with the King every week.\nSo the government and Palace are fundamentally connected through process and personalities. Insiders underline these real relationships are another reason for not taking potshots.\nIn the last few weeks, however, there is no question there's been a bolder appetite in Parliament. Revelation after revelation about Andrew's behaviour has prompted an unusual level of chatter. We've seen MPs trying to force a change in the law for him to lose his titles.\nThe Lib Dems pondered using their allotted time in the Commons to debate cranking up the pressure. And the powerful Public Accounts Committee has been demanding answers over Andrew paying only a peppercorn rent at his home in Windsor. Even though his big brother is calling in the removal vans, the PAC is still waiting for responses to its queries. Depending on the responses it gets, they may still launch a bigger investigation into the financial trail.\nAnd while it still seems unlikely, the committee's MPs could even summon Andrew to give evidence to them.\nAmerican politicians have threatened to do the same - and UK Trade Minister Chris Bryant said on Friday morning he should attend if asked to do so, as any \"decent person\" would.\nEven a few weeks ago, it's hard to imagine those kinds of comments escaping the mouth of any member of a British government.\nThe nature of the allegations - and arguably the Palace's hesitation to take bolder action over a long period of time - has changed the mood, reflecting, as politicians often do, the public's attitude.\n\"The truth is we are very supportive of the Royal Family and the King,\" one opposition source said. \"But lots of people we spoke to knocking on doors were so unhappy, so we felt it needed to get sorted.\"\nUnease about royal behaviour had spread way beyond regular critics of the monarchy – Robert Jenrick and Sir Ed Davey bringing it up \"sent shockwaves\".\nAnd sources suggest messages were being quietly conveyed from government too. One said: \"'people [...] politely saying to the Palace this is not going away and this is difficult - the government saying 'eek, this isn't going away' - will have been part of it.\"\nIt is also the case that the royal furore has been incredibly convenient for the government this week - grabbing headlines while Chancellor Rachel Reeves' behaviour was being questioned.\nDuring royal scandals, \"you breathe a sigh of relief as you guys - the media - go crackers over something else,\" a former No 10 official told me.\nBy her own admission, Reeves broke the rules. She didn't get her story straight at the start. Had the King made his decision a few days earlier or a few days later, the chancellor's embarrassment might have been building into a bigger scandal.\nIt'd be wrong to suggest it was politicians who sent Andrew packing. The King was very unusually heckled. There have been years of unease over Andrew's behaviour. Allegation after allegation.\nSeveral weeks ago Virginia Giuffre's family went on my show and said Lord Mandelson should never have been the UK ambassador to the US.\nBut the role of Parliament and politicians did matter, a source says. Another Whitehall insider tells me it started in Parliament - and the Palace \"would have been aware that it was becoming a bigger issue\" there.\nWhile technically, of course, the monarch is the ultimate boss, Parliament writes the cheques, through what's known as the Sovereign Grant, and has the power to scrutinise the Palace's spending.\nSo what now? Some MPs perhaps have a taste for exerting pressure on the royals. There is the possibility of a full investigation into Andrew's finances. There are already calls for a debate about removing Andrew from the line of succession. That would require a change of the law. It's not a tempting prospect for a weak government to pursue that kind of deeply controversial business.\nBut one insider tells me: \"There are quite a lot of politicians in both houses who have wanted to get into this over the years and now Andrew has opened the door ajar and they can now push it fully open and go in.\"\nPerhaps royal rows will become a more regular part of our political fare.\nWhat another former Downing Street figure described as the \"blanket blah-blah-blah, we can't comment\" approach might have had its day.\nBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

Although it is not our responsibility to apply, we did offer to help with this.\n\"We deeply regret the issue caused to our clients as they would have been under the impression that a licence had been applied for.\"\nA spokesperson for the Conservatives said that - regardless of assurances received from the estate agent - Reeves and her husband were \"responsible\" for ensuring a renting licence had been granted.\nThey have called for Sir Keir Starmer to conduct a \"proper investigation\" into the incident.\nIn her updated statement on Thursday, Reeves said: \"As I said to you today, I am sorry about this matter and accept full responsibility for it.\n\"You rightly expect the highest standards from ministers serving in your government and I have therefore shared the correspondence between my husband and the agency with the Independent Adviser on Ministerial Standards, and I am happy to answer any further questions required.\"\nThe revelations come at a politically awkward time for Reeves, who is preparing for a Budget next month amidst speculation the government could break a manifesto commitment not to raise income tax.", "summary": "(summarizer_error: 401 Client Error: Unauthorized for url: https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions)"}
